        content="This is an incredible story of faith, perseverance, hope, and compassion. Mohanan Nair was just 23 when he met with an accident. His in-laws forced his young, pregnant wife to return to her home. Mohanan was devastated—until a Christian neighbour introduced him to the God of the Bible." />

    <h1 id="i" class="chaptitle lato">A Note From The Publishers</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">A</span>t the age of 23, Mohanan Nair was involved
        in an accident that left him paralysed from the waist down. He came to
        understand the truth of the old saying,
        <i>“As good as dead while I’m still alive.”</i> His youth came to an
        abrupt end. Although he’d been raised as an orthodox <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref008"
                href="#fn008">Hindu</a></span>, he lost all
        hope. The sudden loss of his robust health and vitality shattered his
        spirit, leaving him feeling like a living corpse.
    </p>

    <p>
        During this period of physical and mental collapse, a man visited him,
        spoke to him about Jesus, and prayed for him. This encounter prompted him
        to think differently. As a result of this man’s repeated visits, prayers,
        and his own reading of the Bible, Mohanan Nair accepted Jesus Christ as
        his Saviour. This decision transformed his life. He found meaning in
        existence and learned to make new, purposeful choices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, his wife and son opposed this significant change. However, over
        time, not only did they come to accept it, but they too decided to follow
        Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour. Following this, Mohanan made
        another remarkable decision. He began visiting others who were paralysed,
        with the goal of offering them hope and encouragement and sharing the
        message of Jesus with them. He seeks out those who have been abandoned by
        their families due to their paralysis, bringing them into his home and
        caring for them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite his paralysis, Mohanan gained renewed strength through his faith
        in Jesus Christ. Empowered by this faith, he dedicates himself to finding
        and supporting paralysed individuals, sharing the gospel with them, and
        helping them grow as disciples of Christ. His work is truly commendable.
        His life is now rich with purpose as he travels across Kerala, from north
        to south, preaching about the Lord who gave him a new lease on life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you begin reading this book, you’ll find it hard to put down. The
        events and experiences Mohanan recounts are deeply moving and touch the
        heart. It is our hope that those who don’t yet know Jesus Christ as Lord
        and Saviour will come to know Him through these pages. May their lives be
        transformed, and may they also live as witnesses of the Lord.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan Nair wrote this book in simple, accessible language, and it has
        been beautifully published by Ebenezer Printers. May God bless their
        efforts. We trust that this book will change many lives and extend the
        reach of the gospel to many more. Ebenezer Printers have done a
        commendable job in producing this edition.
    </p>

    <p>
        May God bless their work. May God equip the readers to stand firm for the
        Lord on the battlefield of this world. With this prayer, I humbly dedicate
        this book to the Lord Jesus.

    <h1 id="ii" class="chaptitle">Preface</h1>

    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he eternal God is your refuge, and
        underneath are the everlasting arms” (Deuteronomy 33:27). These words were
        spoken of Jeshurun, the chosen of God. The one who experiences the
        incomparable care of the eternal God is truly blessed. Jesus Christ bore
        the sins of the world on the cross, died, and rose again on the third day.
        Those who have received forgiveness and the salvation of their souls
        through Him remain under God’s unchanging protection and care.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan Nair, the author of this book, lived according to his own ways
        during the years of his ignorance. However, at the appointed time – God’s
        time – he came to know Jesus. At a point of utter despair, broken in both
        body and spirit, he was touched by the love that led Jesus to lay down His
        life to reconcile sinners to God. When Mohanan received Jesus Christ as
        his Saviour and Lord, he found new hope.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jesus gave a new purpose to this man, who had been shattered by paralysis
        following a severe spinal injury. He became a devoted disciple of the One
        who declared, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” Of Jesus, the
        Scripture says, “Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is no
        other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”
    </p>
    <p>
        As Mohanan lived in hope, his circumstances gradually improved. The man
        who once struggled to provide his family with even one meal a day now
        welcomes many visitors to his home daily. Though physically disabled, his
        mind remains vibrant, and he recognises that every event in his life has
        ultimately worked for his good.
    </p>
    <p>
        I first met Mohanan Nair in September 2005 through the kind introduction
        of T. F. James, the managing director of Ebenezer Printers, Thrissur. This
        meeting was followed by several visits to his home in Kaithachal, near
        Koothuparamba in Kannur. I had never encountered anyone like him before.
        Listening to the bitter trials and hardships he and his family endured was
        deeply moving. Yet, I am filled with gratitude for the salvation of Jesus
        Christ that reaches people from all walks of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        How many lives have been touched by the truth through this man! And how
        remarkable are the selfless services of his wife, Thankamani! As the Queen
        of Sheba said to Solomon, “I hadn’t heard even half the story! I had see
        it for myself to get the full picture.” Their lives must be witnessed to
        be fully appreciated. I encourage readers to call, write, or, if possible,
        visit them to understand the extraordinary story of this family.
    </p>
    <p>
        I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Brother James, who inspired the writing
        of this book, and to C. I. George, Evangelist, Emmanuel Publications, who
        undertook its publication.

    <h1 id="iii" class="chaptitle-prelims">Dedication</h1>
    <p class="firstpara"><span class="dropcap"></span></p>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">C</span>ome and hear, all you who fear God; let me
        tell you what He has done for me” (Psalm 66:16). I was born into a
        <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref008" href="#fn008">Hindu</a></span>
        family and grew up in deep poverty. From a young age, my life was marked
        by pain and hardship. Then, in the prime of my youth, an accident changed
        everything. I was left paralysed below the waist, confined to a bed and
        wheelchair.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through this book, I want to share the incredible paradox of my life with
        you. On one side, there was unimaginable pain and rejection. But on the
        other, I found something extraordinary: the Creator of the universe. When
        I came to know Him personally, I discovered a peace, joy, and hope I’d
        never known before—and forgiveness for all my sins.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1993, I wrote a little booklet called
        <i>Enduring Peace in the Furnace of Pain</i>, where I shared about the
        first four years of my life as a paraplegic, starting when I was just 24.
        It seemed to strike a chord with many people, and its impact led to an
        expanded edition in 1997. That edition sold out quickly, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, a few of my brothers in Christ encouraged me to write more
        about my journey. With the kind help of my friend Jayamohan Athirunkal, I
        wrote <i>Safe In the Everlasting Arms</i>, which was published in 2008.
        That book also sold out within a year, and the stories I shared touched
        many lives. People from all over the world called me to say how much it
        had blessed them. Some said it brought them to the foot of the Cross,
        leading them to repentance and a deeper connection with Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Encouraged by this response, I expanded the book and released a second
        edition.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you read these pages, I hope they touch your heart. You might find
        yourself crying, laughing, reflecting, or even hearing God’s voice.
        Whatever happens, my prayer is that you’ll let what you read move you to
        reconsider your life and take a step closer to the Lord Jesus. Nothing
        would bring me more joy than knowing this book helps you seek Him.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m so grateful to Ebenezer Printers for their enthusiastic support in
        bringing this book to life. Above all, I dedicate this book to the Lord
        Jesus Christ. Like the psalmist, I can say, “Before I was afflicted, I
        went astray, but now you have turned my suffering into good.” In my
        darkest moments, He delivered me—not just from physical hardship, but from
        death and hell itself. His mighty hands have carried me through all these
        years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jesus is the living hope of humanity, the true God, and eternal life. May
        God bless you richly as you read this book.

        <span class="dropcap">O</span>ver 37 years ago, my life took an unexpected
        turn. At the age of 24, an accident left me paralysed from the waist down.
        It was a shattering experience, but it also marked the beginning of a
        journey filled with lessons I never imagined. From 1986 to 1992, I lived
        through six challenging years—years of intense suffering but also moments
        of indescribable joy, hope, and peace, all made possible by the presence
        of God in the midst of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Encouraged by some brothers in Christ, I shared these experiences in a
        small book called <i>The Furnace of Pain</i>. The first print run of 1,000
        copies brought comfort to many. Later, brothers from the Vishtanugami
        Sangh in Kannur reprinted it under the title
        <i>Enduring Peace in the Furnace of Pain</i>, and those 1,000 copies were
        quickly taken up as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then, I’ve been blessed to share more of my journey in the book
        <i>Safe In the Everlasting Arms</i>, published by Ebenezer Printers,
        Thrissur. This book reflects on how God’s work in our lives has surpassed
        anything I could have hoped for, dreamed about, prayed for, or even
        imagined back when I wrote the earlier booklets.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most amazing outcomes of this journey has been
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>
        (The House Of Compassion), which became a reality 20 years ago. Despite
        our trials, our family has grown and thrived in ways that have been a
        testimony to many. What seemed like an utterly broken and useless life
        has, by God’s grace, become a blessing to thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Safe In the Everlasting Arms</i> has been reprinted four times now,
        with 14,000 copies distributed to readers from all walks of life. The book
        has helped countless people find peace, joy, and hope through a
        relationship with the living God. Many have told me how it’s helped them
        discover the true meaning of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        To reach even more people, I agreed to have the book translated into
        English. A few brothers in Chennai are generously financing the
        publication of the print version, which has been lightly edited to make it
        clearer and more concise. My hope is that this English edition will lead
        many readers to know the living God and experience eternal life through
        Him.
    </p>
    <p>
        May this book be a blessing to you, and may you find the peace and purpose
        you’ve been searching for in the arms of the Almighty.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Dark Night of Despair</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he axe bit deep into the towering tree, the
        rhythmic thwack echoing through the countryside as Mohanan Nair swung it
        with practised precision. His muscular arms made light work of the task,
        his love for labour driving him to push through fatigue, often well into
        the night. Today, however, he’d completed most of his work by midday, with
        plenty of time to tackle another task he’d in mind.
    </p>
    <p>But God had other plans.</p>
    <p>
        Without warning, the colossal tree groaned and toppled—not in the
        direction Mohanan had anticipated. A massive branch splintered away and
        came crashing down, striking him with the force of a hammer. He was flung
        through the air and hit the ground with a sickening thud. A surge of
        excruciating pain ripped through him, but it lasted only a fleeting moment
        before an eerie numbness set in. His legs were lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alarmed villagers rushed to his aid and carried him to the modest local
        hospital in Iritty. By the time they arrived, Mohanan could no longer feel
        anything below his waist. The staff quickly arranged his transfer to the
        prestigious
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QVmxepPfNfwUihAK8" target="_blank">Calicut Government Medical College
            Hospital</a>, known as the region’s foremost medical institution. There, amidst the
        bustling corridors and impersonal efficiency, Mohanan lay for three
        gruelling weeks. His days were marked by brief, perfunctory visits from
        doctors but no meaningful answers or hope.
    </p>
    <p>
        After twenty-two agonising days, Mohanan begged his elder brother to seek
        answers directly from the doctor at his residence—a common practice in
        those days, often yielding better results than hospital consultations.
        When his brother returned, his sombre silence spoke volumes. Mohanan’s
        heart sank. His relentless questioning finally broke through his brother’s
        hesitation. The verdict was devastating:
        <em>Mohanan was paralysed for life</em>. His spinal cord had been
        irreparably damaged, and no medical intervention could reverse it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan refused to accept this grim diagnosis. He convinced himself it was
        a convenient excuse for the hospital’s limitations. Determined to seek
        better care, he turned to their trusted family doctor, Dr Balagopal, who
        suggested a transfer to the renowned
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/a5qikjgYcUu4UeSC8" target="_blank">Elite Mission Hospital</a>
        in Thrissur. Run by Professor Surendran, a highly respected surgeon
        trained in the United States, the hospital held the promise of expertise
        and cutting-edge care.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clinging to hope, Mohanan spent his life savings of Rupees 1,250 to hire
        an ambulance for the journey. At
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/a5qikjgYcUu4UeSC8" target="_blank">Elite Mission Hospital</a>, surgeons
        stabilised his damaged spine, removing fragments of shattered
        vertebrae. For three long months, he remained under their care, but the
        bills mounted to a staggering Rupees 20,000—a fortune in those days. The
        financial burden was eased by contributions from his wife’s family and
        generous neighbours, but the weight of despair grew heavier with each
        passing day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the surgical intervention, the outcome remained bleak. On the day
        of his discharge, Professor Surendran entered Mohanan’s room, carrying a
        backrest to help him sit up for the first time since the accident. What
        should’ve been a moment of triumph felt hollow. The doctor hesitated
        before breaking the news: “Mohanan, I’m afraid this is the best we can do.
        Your spinal cord was severed in the accident. Medical science offers no
        cure.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The words hit Mohanan like a thunderclap. He screamed in disbelief,
        pleading for an alternative, a miracle—anything.
    </p>

    <img src="./img/016-eng.webp" alt="" />

    <p>
        The doctor’s voice
        softened, his own eyes brimming with unshed tears. “I’m sorry. There is
        nothing more we can do. God bless you.” With that, he turned and left,
        leaving Mohanan sobbing uncontrollably.
    </p>
    <p>
        The nurses, over 40 of them, came by to bid him farewell, their warmth and
        encouragement unable to pierce the fog of despair that enveloped him. In a
        final gesture of goodwill, the hospital waived his last month’s bills, but
        Mohanan remained inconsolable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back home, his family desperately searched for other avenues. Could the
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/d1wsobAZBGbdbTMK6" target="_blank">Christian Medical College</a>
        in Vellore or
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/i9Bb6n2dcAwZF8Rz8" target="_blank">Kasturba Medical College</a>
        in Manipal offer a solution? Every enquiry yielded the same answer: no.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus began the darkest chapter of Mohanan’s life. Trapped in a broken
        body, his spirit writhed under the weight of hopelessness. Just eight
        months into his marriage, with his wife expecting their first child, he
        was consumed by unanswerable questions. How could he, once the pillar of
        his family, now be a burden? How could he endure the humiliation of
        relying on others to feed, clothe, and clean him for the rest of his life?
    </p>
    <p>
        Sleepless nights became the norm as his mind spiralled into despair. The
        future seemed like an unrelenting void. He prayed fervently to the gods he
        had always believed in, pleading for a glimmer of hope. None came.
        Bitterness and anger consumed him.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea of ending his life became a constant companion. The thought, once
        abhorrent, began to feel strangely comforting—a way to escape the
        unbearable darkness. Each day, he wrestled with this temptation, his mind
        teetering on the edge. To live felt like torture; to die, an alluring
        release.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan was trapped in an abyss, with no light to guide him out. It seemed
        as though even hope had abandoned him.
    </p>

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Early Life</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan’s father, Kunhikannan, was born in
        the small hamlet of
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tZaESTdQQVT3f2ku9" target="_blank">Chittariparambu</a>
        near Koothuparamba in Kannur district, situated in the verdant south
        Indian state of Kerala. Despite being born with only one arm, Kunhikannan
        was determined to lead a life of dignity. He found work as a headload
        labourer in the village of
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/91rPq6ypu1gC8A18A" target="_blank">Koottupuzha</a>, nestled amidst the lush
        rainforests of the Western Ghats. His earnings,
        though modest, were sufficient to support himself and eventually fund his
        marriage to Lakshmiamma, a woman from an equally old but impoverished
        <span class="bold"><a id="ref001" href="#fn001">Nair</a></span>
        family.
    </p>
    <p>
        The couple went on to have five children, of whom Mohanan was the third.
        Born in
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tZaESTdQQVT3f2ku9" target="_blank">Chittariparambu</a>, Mohanan spent his
        formative years in Koottupuzha, where the family
        endured grinding poverty. The constant struggle to make ends meet meant
        that education was a luxury they could not afford. Mohanan’s older
        siblings left school before they turned thirteen to help supplement the
        family income, and he, too, dropped out after completing the sixth grade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their village was surrounded by sprawling fields and plantations owned by
        wealthy families, many of whom were Catholic settlers from southern
        Kerala. These settlers had carved out new farms from the dense, virgin
        forest. Mohanan recalls that, despite their Christian identity, they were
        no different from the other villagers when it came to vices. Addictions,
        selfishness, quarrels, and even violence were commonplace. The settlers
        often clashed with Mohanan’s family, and arguments frequently escalated
        into physical altercations. Their behaviour left a deep impression on
        young Mohanan, who grew to detest the perceived superiority these settlers
        derived from their religion, despite their glaring moral failings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan’s first job was as a cashew picker on a plantation. He worked
        tirelessly from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., earning a meagre 1.5 rupees a day. In
        addition to plucking cashews, he was often tasked with a range of other
        duties to fill his workday.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the age of twelve, Mohanan had taken on gruelling physical labour. He
        carried heavy loads, felled trees, ploughed fields, and built bunds to
        protect farmland. As he grew older, his repertoire expanded to include
        construction work, well-digging, and other agricultural tasks. His father,
        now severely crippled by arthritis, was no longer able to contribute much
        to the family’s income. The burden of providing for the household fell
        squarely on the shoulders of the older children. Mohanan, driven by a
        fierce sense of responsibility, often took on night shifts after
        completing a full day’s work, determined to ensure that his younger
        siblings at least had one meal a day.
    </p>
    <p>
        One incident from Mohanan’s childhood remained etched in his memory. He
        was thirteen years old and returning home after a week of back-breaking
        labour, clutching his wages with a sense of pride. As he neared the house,
        the sound of his younger siblings’ wails greeted him. His mother,
        tear-streaked and weary, recounted what had transpired. Desperate to
        provide for his family, Kunhikannan had resorted to brewing illicit
        liquor, a desperate measure given his inability to perform physical
        labour. However, the authorities had caught wind of his activities, and he
        had been arrested by officials from the Excise Department.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Mohanan, this was the final straw. In a fit of rage and determination,
        he seized a chopper and smashed the brewing equipment and the fireplace
        where it had been set up. Standing amid the wreckage, he declared that
        such disgrace would never again taint their home. His actions marked a
        turning point for the family; no one ever attempted to brew liquor again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience left a profound impact on Mohanan. He developed a lifelong
        aversion to alcohol, seeing it as a source of shame and misery. Not only
        did he remain abstinent throughout his life, but he also became a vocal
        advocate against drinking, often admonishing his friends about its
        destructive consequences.
    </p>

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Disillusionment</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">K</span>unhikannan, Mohanan’s father, was raised
        with an unwavering reverence for the
        <span class="bold"><a id="ref002" href="#fn002">gods</a></span>. He dutifully performed elaborate
        <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref003" href="#fn003">puja</a></span>
        and offerings, making solemn vows whenever misfortune struck. True to his
        word, he always fulfilled these vows, no matter the cost. However, this
        devoutness placed a severe strain on the family’s already meagre finances.
        Often, the children went hungry, their weakened bodies falling prey to
        illness. Kunhikannan saw these ailments as manifestations of the gods’
        displeasure, though the reasons for their anger often remained a mystery
        to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Encouraged by the family astrologer, Kunhikannan constructed shrine after
        shrine in their yard, each one dedicated to a deity he hoped to appease.
        Every idol demanded its own specific offerings: Muthappan required a
        combination of boiled legumes, coconut, dried fish, and toddy; another
        deity insisted on pounded rice flakes and flowers; yet another demanded
        the blood of sacrificial animals.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the rituals were completed and the astrologer had left, strict rules
        governed the shrines. No one was allowed to approach them, for the gods’
        presence was considered sacred and fearsome. The family, however, was
        permitted to partake of a small portion of the offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
        One evening, Mohanan sat outside, gazing at the flickering flames of the
        oil lamps glowing faintly in front of each shrine. His mind churned with
        questions. “We honour the gods with all these offerings and rituals,” he
        thought. “Father says they are pleased, that they relish what we give
        them. Yet they remain silent, invisible. What is God truly like? Does God
        see or hear our suffering?”
    </p>
    <p>
        As his thoughts wandered, an unusual sound interrupted his musings. The
        dry leaves in the courtyard began to rustle, as though someone—or
        something—was moving towards the shrines. His curiosity piqued, Mohanan
        hesitated. His father had often warned him that gazing upon a deity would
        bring death, but his yearning to witness the divine overcame his fear.
        Shrinking into the shadows of the house, he watched intently.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rustling grew louder. At last, Mohanan saw the source of the noise. To
        his astonishment, it was the neighbours’ dog. The animal had stealthily
        crept into the yard and was devouring the offerings meant for the gods. It
        greedily lapped up the blood of the sacrificial rooster and consumed
        whatever else it could find. Mohanan was stunned. The sight deeply
        disturbed him, shaking the foundation of his faith in these rituals. For
        the first time, doubts crept into his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        A second incident sealed his growing scepticism. Every evening,
        Kunhikannan dutifully filled the oil lamps in front of the shrines and lit
        them. Yet, inexplicably, the flames would extinguish within minutes.
        Convinced this was an ill omen, Kunhikannan would erupt in anger, blaming
        his family for failing to uphold the gods’ standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Determined to uncover the truth, Mohanan decided to investigate.
        Concealing himself in the shadows one night, he observed the courtyard
        closely. To his surprise, a plump cat crept silently toward the lamps.
        With delicate precision, the cat patted out each flame with its paw and
        then lapped up the clarified butter used as fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
        These incidents profoundly altered Mohanan’s perspective. He came to see
        the elaborate rituals, sacrifices, and astrologers’ pronouncements as
        nothing more than a web of superstition. To him, they were tools crafted
        by priests, astrologers, and magicians to exploit the ignorance of
        ordinary people, draining them of their hard-earned money under the guise
        of appeasing unseen powers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, despite his disillusionment with these practices, Mohanan’s faith in
        the existence of a higher power remained unshaken. Deep within, he longed
        to discover who or what the true God might be. He channelled this
        spiritual yearning into devotion to
        <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref004" href="#fn004">Ayyappan</a></span>, the Hindu deity revered at the
        renowned Sabarimala temple. This new
        phase of his journey also spurred an interest in exploring Indian
        philosophy and thought, as he sought answers to the profound questions
        that troubled his heart.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">In Search Of The World’s Pleasures</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">Y</span>oung people often immerse themselves in
        fleeting pleasures, chasing momentary joys and superficial amusements.
        Mohanan was no different. At the age of twelve, he experienced the allure
        of cinema when a neighbour invited him to a theatre. That outing marked
        the beginning of an infatuation with movies and film stars that consumed
        him for a time and steered him toward other unwholesome habits.
    </p>
    <p>
        Between the ages of twelve and twenty-three, Mohanan’s life seemed to slip
        by in a haze of indulgence. His motto could well have been, “Eat, drink,
        and be merry.” Most of his free time was spent in the company of friends,
        engaging in idle chatter. They smoked, debated politics, dissected the
        latest movies, and revelled in their carefree existence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Raised in a strictly vegetarian household, Mohanan eventually broke this
        tradition when he tried meat for the first time—and discovered that he
        enjoyed it. When his family learned of this transgression, they barred him
        from participating in <i>puja</i>. To Mohanan, this was hardly a
        punishment; by then, he’d already lost interest in religious rituals and
        welcomed the reprieve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, however, he began to recognise the grip his habits had on him.
        Slowly but decisively, he distanced himself from his circle of friends.
        This transformation was not sudden but was helped along by a growing sense
        of responsibility towards his younger siblings.
    </p>
    <p>
        As he matured, Mohanan’s priorities shifted. The once-carefree boy began
        to devote most of his waking hours to hard work, determined to support his
        family and provide for his siblings. This newfound sense of duty became a
        guiding force in his life, steering him away from the distractions and
        indulgences of his youth.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Wedding And The Accident</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">A</span>t twenty-two, Mohanan was working as an
        overseer on a plantation, twelve kilometres away from his home. It was
        here that he first met
        <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref005" href="#fn005">Thankamani</a></span>, a labourer on the same estate.
        Like him, she came from a modest
        <span class="bold"><a id="ref001" href="#fn001">Nair</a></span>
        family and was the fourth of five children living in a nearby village.
        From the moment they met, Mohanan felt an undeniable connection—he knew he
        had found his soulmate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The match was eventually approved by both families, and they were married
        a year later, shortly after Mohanan turned twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
        This marked the brightest phase of his life. For the first time, he
        experienced the profound sweetness of a woman’s love. Their days together
        were filled with joy, and their marital bliss appeared to accelerate the
        passage of time. Eight months into their marriage,
        <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref005" href="#fn005">Thankamani</a></span>
        was three months pregnant, and the couple eagerly anticipated the arrival
        of their first child. Mohanan worked tirelessly, balancing daily wage
        labour with farming to ensure a secure future for his growing family.
    </p>
    <p>
        But on 8 March 1986, everything changed. Mohanan was working for a man
        named George Puthuparambil in
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/q9g9T1eBRQMcLJXJA">Vallithode</a>,
        cutting down trees. Determined to finish by noon, he hurried through his
        tasks, hoping to dedicate the rest of the day to his own work. This
        relentless drive was his way of making ends meet.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an instant, tragedy struck, shattering all his dreams. The accident
        crushed his hopes in one cruel stroke, plunging him into a world of pain
        and despair. The pages that follow recount the unimaginable suffering he
        endured—far more than anyone should’ve to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, this is not where Mohanan’s story ends. The latter part of his
        journey takes on a different tone, as the darkest moment of his life
        became the turning point that brought light not just to him, but to many
        others. Through this tragedy, God worked a profound transformation. Sorrow
        was turned into joy, despair into hope, and Mohanan’s helplessness was
        transmuted into a strength that could uplift others.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Driven To Atheism By Desperation</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Mohanan returned home from Elite Mission
        Hospital, his recovery continued under the care of his family. For three
        more months, they did everything they could to help him, including
        summoning priests and astrologers. Yet, despite their charms and elaborate
        <i>puja</i> there was no relief. The old astrologer blamed the accident on
        the Evil Eye, supposedly cast by a jealous neighbour. In his desperation,
        Mohanan found himself clinging once more to the superstitions he’d
        abandoned, grasping for even the faintest glimmer of hope to lift his
        despair. But nothing changed. His nights were plagued by relentless
        nightmares that left him waking in terror, and sleep became as elusive as
        solace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Months of constant anxiety and anguish left Mohanan in a state of utter
        emotional collapse. He felt like a shell of a man, worse than useless—a
        crushing burden on his impoverished family. Reduced to helplessness, he
        was entirely dependent on others for even the most basic and private
        aspects of his care. His condition worsened when he developed painful
        bedsores, a stark physical reminder of his suffering. Each day brought
        fresh waves of tears and hopeless prayers, as he searched in vain for
        comfort. Night after night, his pillow was soaked with his weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
        His parents, overwhelmed by the astrologer’s grim prediction that Mohanan
        would not survive more than three months, cared for him as best they
        could. Yet, as weeks turned into months, Mohanan’s strength began to
        return, defying those fatalistic forecasts. With time, he managed to sit
        up, using a backrest for support. It became clear that he was not going to
        succumb to his injuries as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        This realisation, however, brought a new and painful reality. Struggling
        under the weight of poverty, his family began to see him not as a loved
        one in need, but as a financial and emotional burden. Their patience wore
        thin, and resentment grew. They began to taunt him for his helplessness,
        throwing his past mistakes in his face while conveniently ignoring the
        years of toil he’d endured to support them since he was twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first, Mohanan tried to shrug off their barbs, but the constant mockery
        and indifference became too much to bear. Tensions escalated into bitter
        quarrels, leaving him isolated in his despair. The faith that had once
        anchored him began to erode under the weight of these dark days, and he
        felt himself slipping into a chasm of hopelessness, unsure if he’d ever
        find a way out.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="7" class="chapnum">7</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Man Sent By God</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">D</span>uring his early days of recovery, Mohanan
        received many visitors from neighbouring homes and villages. They came to
        share his sorrow and offer comfort, often bringing small gifts or modest
        sums of money. Women, in particular, were moved to tears upon seeing the
        once-vibrant young man reduced to a shadow of his former self. Yet,
        despite their sympathy, no one could offer him true solace.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, a man named V. C. Sebastian visited. Known as Babychayan—<i>achayan</i>
        being a respectful term for elder men—he was the husband of Mohanan’s
        former neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Mohanan poured out his heart, describing his hopeless condition,
        Babychayan listened intently, without interrupting or reacting
        emotionally. When Mohanan finished, he concluded bitterly, “So,
        Babychayan, there is no God. If there were, why would I be in this state
        today?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Without hesitation, Babychayan replied gently, “My son, there is indeed a
        God behind this universe.”
    </p>
    <p>Mockingly, Mohanan asked, “Who is this God, then?”</p>


    <img src="./img/031-eng.webp" alt="" />
    
    <p>Babychayan responded without pause, “He is the Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
    <p>
        The answer startled and angered Mohanan. He had always harboured a deep
        resentment towards the Christian settlers in his area, who, despite their
        outward religiosity, showed little love for God or their neighbours. Into
        the storm of Mohanan’s bitter thoughts came Babychayan’s calm voice:
    </p>
    <p>
        “The Lord Jesus Christ is the only one who has come into the world to save
        sinners. He is the Saviour of all. There is no forgiveness of sins apart
        from Him. Anyone who believes in Jesus Christ with all their heart
        receives forgiveness and eternal life. He is the source of true joy and
        peace.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan tried to ignore him, his scepticism firmly rooted. Sensing this
        resistance, Babychayan rose to leave but asked, “May I pray for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan replied curtly, “As you wish. But I’m not interested in prayer.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite being raised in a faith with countless gods, Mohanan’s prayers had
        never brought him peace or hope. He had all but given up on life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Babychayan knelt beside him and prayed fervently, tears streaming down his
        face. “Dear Father, open this young man’s eyes. I know you love him.
        Please deliver him. Save him from sin, from sickness, from the curse.
        Reveal yourself to him, Lord, so that he may find salvation.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan listened, astonished. He thought,
        <i>Why would this man, who isn’t my relative or even of my religion, weep
            and pray for me?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before leaving, Babychayan shook Mohanan’s hand and lingered a moment
        longer. “I wasn’t always like this,” he said quietly. “Six years ago,
        though I was raised in a Christian family, I didn’t know Christ.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The confession shocked Mohanan. He thought,
        <i>How could a Christian not know the God he worships?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Babychayan continued, “I smoked over a hundred cigarettes a day and drank
        more than a litre of arrack daily. I did whatever I pleased, but none of
        it brought me peace. I was active in church and even served on the church
        committee, yet I didn’t know Christ. My life was a mess. Constant
        headaches plagued me, and I couldn’t even manage my own five-acre farm.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I sought medical help, visiting renowned hospitals in Manipal and
        Vellore, and underwent two surgeries, but nothing changed. Finally, at a
        family prayer meeting organised by the Pota Retreat Centre, I prayed in
        desperation: ‘Jesus, unless you heal me, I’ll die here.’ That night, I
        experienced a vision—a heavenly light—and my headaches vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’d like to give you a book,” Babychayan added. “Will you read it? If
        Jesus Christ doesn’t give you peace, eternal life, and hope, I’ll never
        preach this message again. I’m not an evangelist by profession. I only
        visit the sick and suffering during my free time to share this good news.”
    </p>
    <p>
        At the door, he reiterated, “I’ll bring you a book. Please read it!” He
        wisely refrained from mentioning that the book was a Bible, knowing
        Mohanan’s prejudice against Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
        About a week later, Babychayan’s wife, Ani, who had been Mohanan’s
        neighbour, came to visit, carrying the promised book. Handing it to him,
        she said warmly, “Here it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Suspicious, Mohanan asked, “Are you sure I’ll be able to read this?” He
        was used to <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref009" href="#fn009">Hindu religious texts</a></span> written in
        Sanskrit, which were
        difficult to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ani reassured him, “Of course, Mohanan. It’s in Malayalam—our mother
        tongue. Anyone can read and understand it.”
    </p>
    <p>
        She opened the book to the New Testament and suggested, “You could start
        here. The Old Testament might be harder to follow at first.”
    </p>
    <p>
        And so, for the first time in his life, Mohanan began to read the Bible.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="8" class="chapnum">8</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Quest For The Truth</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">D</span>riven by curiosity, Mohanan swiftly read
        through the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, eager to uncover the
        message within the “Christians’ book.” However, encountering the same
        story repeated across these first three Gospels, he grew impatient and
        skipped the <i>Gospel of John</i> altogether, diving directly into the
        <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the next few months, he read significant portions of the Bible but
        eventually set it aside. He turned instead to novels that his brother
        brought home from the local library. These stories helped him pass the
        time and occasionally lulled him into short, restless naps. Yet, their
        distraction was fleeting. Bored and dissatisfied, Mohanan found himself
        returning to the Bible, hoping it might offer solace for his troubled
        mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        This time, he began with the Gospel of John. When he reached the
        fourteenth chapter, one verse stopped him in his tracks:
        <i>“I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but
            by me”</i>
        (John 14:6).
    </p>
    <p>
        The words pierced his heart. He read them again and again, struck by their
        audacity and power. He realized that no historical figure, no matter how
        great, could claim such authority. This statement wasn’t merely
        philosophical or metaphorical; it was absolute. In that moment, his
        understanding shifted. His inner eyes were opened, and his thoughts grew
        startlingly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Jesus Christ truly is <i>the Way</i> to the Creator, Mohanan reasoned,
        then all paths <em>cannot</em> logically lead to the same God. He
        reflected on the divisions among religions and the conflicts they sparked.
        How could people who quarreled over their visible differences—religion,
        caste, race—claim to love an invisible, transcendent God? This realization
        spurred him to delve deeper into the New Testament, searching it with the
        fervor of a treasure hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, Mohanan reached the final book of the Bible, the Revelation of
        John. Here, another verse gripped him:
        <i>“Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.
            Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and
            opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with
            me”</i>
        (Revelation 3:19–20).
    </p>
    <p>
        These words, spoken by Jesus nearly fifty years after His resurrection,
        were addressed to His beloved disciple John, who was in exile on the
        island of Patmos. To Mohanan, they felt intensely personal, as though
        Jesus Himself were speaking directly to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        The meaning unfolded in his mind: God disciplines those He loves. His
        suffering wasn’t a curse but a sign of divine care—a form of fatherly
        correction. The next verse’s command to “be earnest and repent” became a
        call to action. He began to examine his life honestly, confronting the
        sinful thoughts, actions, and attitudes he’d previously ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
        This self-reflection led to a profound realization: he’d lived without
        truly knowing, believing in, or obeying the one true God. The
        understanding that God’s discipline was rooted in love began to soften
        Mohanan’s weary, hardened heart, much like a life-giving rain shower
        revives dry, parched earth.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the first time, he saw his suffering not as meaningless pain but as
        purposeful discipline, akin to the way loving parents raise their children
        through guidance and correction. He felt an awakening—a deep desire to
        respond to God’s call with humility and repentance, allowing his heart and
        mind to be transformed.
    </p>

    <p id="9" class="chapnum">9</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Shunned By Parents</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">O</span>ne afternoon, while Mohanan was reading the
        Bible, his father, Kunhikannan, entered the shack. At the sight of the
        book, anger flared in his eyes. Memories of his unpleasant encounters with
        so-called Christians –settlers who had taken over local lands and
        frequently clashed with him and his community – rose to the surface. The
        sight of his son embracing what he perceived as the oppressor’s religion
        was too much to bear. Without a word, Kunhikannan stormed out, his fury
        palpable.
    </p>
    <p>
        By this point, six months had passed since Mohanan’s accident, and his
        parents had grown weary of the burden. They began to lash out with sharp,
        biting remarks about his life and choices. When Mohanan’s elder brother,
        who had been his main caregiver, tried to defend him, the situation
        escalated. The parents, frustrated and unyielding, turned their anger on
        the brother. A heated quarrel ensued, and he was ultimately forbidden from
        returning to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
        This event hit Mohanan hardest. Losing his brother’s care and
        companionship left him feeling abandoned and desolate. The despair
        overwhelmed him, driving him to the edge. In a moment of hopelessness, he
        attempted to end his life, pounding on his chest with all the strength he
        could muster. But before any significant harm was done, he collapsed into
        unconsciousness—a stark reminder of his utter helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mercifully, his brother, unwilling to abandon him entirely, took Mohanan
        into his own home. There, he arranged a makeshift open shed on the side of
        the hut to serve as Mohanan’s shelter. Though modest, it offered him a
        degree of stability and solace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Around this time, news arrived that brightened Mohanan’s spirits, if only
        briefly. His wife, Thankamani, had given birth to their child at her
        ancestral home in Trivandrum, located at the southern tip of Kerala. The
        thought of becoming a father filled him with joy, and he eagerly wrote to
        her, asking her to name the child Jayaprakash.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, this happiness was soon overshadowed by fresh waves of sorrow. The
        news of his child’s birth reminded him of all he could not do. He couldn’t
        see his child, let alone hold him. Worse, he felt utterly incapable of
        providing for his young family. These thoughts deepened his sense of
        inadequacy as a husband and father.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even now, as Mohanan reflects on those long, bitter days, the sting of
        helplessness remains. The memory of his struggles, both physical and
        emotional, lingers—a painful testament to a time when his world seemed to
        crumble around him.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Truth Revealed</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan’s elder brother exhibited an
        unwavering kindness and compassion that deeply moved him. When he brought
        Mohanan into his home, he treated him not as a burden but as a cherished
        member of the family, caring for him as if he were his fourth child.
        Despite his brother’s tenderness, Mohanan could not escape the shadow of
        his parents’ disapproval. Living just a short distance away, they
        continued to hurl accusations, harsh words, and palpable disdain in his
        direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Though my brother showed me the greatest tenderness,” Mohanan later
        reflected, “one painful truth was impossible to ignore: my stay with him
        was a temporary solution, not a permanent one. I was only 24 years old.
        What if I lived another fifty years? I couldn’t burden him for a lifetime.
        I even voiced this fear to him once. He reassured me, promising that as
        long as he lived, we would share the same food, no matter how little it
        might be. But I knew in my heart that such reassurances couldn’t last
        forever. Even the most compassionate people have their limits. Over time,
        I stopped speaking of my fears to him, realizing they were mine to grapple
        with alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Desperate for peace, Mohanan turned again to the Bible. He meditated on
        passages that had caught his attention, seeking solace and guidance. Yet,
        despite his efforts, his heart remained restless.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though he read the Bible frequently, Mohanan still viewed it as “the
        Christians’ book,” a text filled with moral principles he admired but
        struggled to live by. He prayed often, reciting the Lord’s Prayer:
        <i>“Our Father who art in heaven…”</i> But true rest and peace continued
        to elude him.
    </p>
    <p>
        During another visit from Babychayan, Mohanan decided to voice his inner
        turmoil. “How can I follow the sublime teachings of the Bible?” he asked.
        “It tells me not to do wrong, but I still do wrong. For instance, it
        equates anger to murder, and yet I constantly feel anger towards my
        family. It says it is wrong to lust after a woman, but I still have
        wrongful desires. Every religion teaches good principles, but even the
        teachers fail to follow them. That’s my problem—in fact, it’s the human
        problem. I want to do good, but I end up doing the evil I despise. Oh,
        what a wretched man I am!”
    </p>
    <p>
        Then came the question that struck at the heart of his struggle: “Is this
        the experience of you Christians as well? Do you find yourselves unable to
        follow your own teachings?”
    </p>
    <p>
        In response, Babychayan opened the Bible to Romans 3:10-18 and read aloud:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none
        that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all
        gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none
        that doeth good, no, not one.
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used
        deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of
        cursing and bitterness: Their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction
        and misery are in their ways: and the way of peace have they not known:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</p>
    <p>
        Mohanan was struck by the stark clarity of these words. “To my amazement,”
        he later recalled, “these verses captured the human condition with brutal
        honesty. For the first time, I understood that people are sinners, no
        matter their religion or community.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Then Babychayan turned to another passage, this time from 1 John 1:7-9:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “But if we walk in the light, as he (God) is in the light, we have
        fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
        cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
        ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
        <i>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
            and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        These words pierced Mohanan’s heart. In them, he heard not only a
        diagnosis of his condition but also a lifeline of hope. He realized that
        he was a sinner, broken and flawed. But more importantly, he saw that God
        had provided a way of salvation—through Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
        At that moment, the weight of his despair began to lift. Mohanan had
        encountered a truth that spoke directly to his weary soul: God saves
        sinners, and His love and forgiveness are extended to all who turn to Him
        in faith.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="11" class="chapnum">11</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">A New Beginning</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>hat October night in 1986, a profound
        conviction descended upon Mohanan amidst his deep physical and emotional
        anguish. It marked the turning point of his life. Through his readings of
        the Bible, he already understood that Jesus Christ had died, been buried,
        and risen again on the third day. Around midnight, he felt an unmistakable
        voice within him—God’s voice—declaring:
        <em>“Call upon the name of the living God and be saved, or you will perish
            in eternal damnation.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The command left no room for hesitation. Mohanan prayed, confessing for
        the first time in his life, “O God, I am a sinful man.” With a trembling
        heart, he asked for forgiveness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    </p>

    <p>
        As he prayed, his entire life seemed to replay before him, like a vivid
        panorama of secret and open sins stretching back to his childhood. His
        stubbornness, pride, and self-righteousness dissolved under the weight of
        this revelation. His heart broke, and he wept as he’d never wept before.
        In that moment of vulnerability, he felt the Lord Jesus Christ comforting
        him, like a mother gently consoling her child.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly, Mohanan knew, with unshakable certainty, that Jesus Christ was
        the living God. A peace unlike anything he’d ever experienced flooded his
        soul, washing away the fear and despair that had plagued him for eight
        long, sleepless months. That night, for the first time since his accident,
        he slept deeply and restfully. He awoke the next morning filled with a joy
        and hope he hadn’t thought possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reflecting on that experience, Mohanan later said: “Peace is a rare
        treasure in this turbulent life. The Lord Jesus said,
        <em>‘Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives
            do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be
            afraid.’</em>
        (John 14:27). Many believe peace is tied to smooth circumstances—marriage,
        wealth, status, or possessions. But these things are fleeting. The moment
        they are lost or disrupted, so too is our peace. Can such transient
        feelings truly be called peace?
    </p>

    <p>
        “True peace is not of this world. The day humanity broke its relationship
        with God, peace was lost. Today, we see this unrest in individuals,
        families, and nations. People turn to alcohol, drugs, and fleeting
        pleasures in a desperate attempt to find peace, but these only deepen
        their troubles. The Lord Jesus suffered and bore our punishment to grant
        us true peace.
        <em>‘The punishment for our peace was upon Him, and by His wounds, we are
            healed,’</em>
        says Isaiah 53:5.
    </p>

    <p>
        “When I became a paraplegic, abandoned by my own family, I lost all
        earthly hope. But in my darkest hour, Jesus entered my life. The peace,
        rest, and hope He brought to my heart is indescribable. Anyone who
        believes in Him can experience this same eternal peace. The Word of God
        declares, ‘We who have believed enter that rest.’ (Hebrews 4:3).”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan emphasized:
        <em>“Sin is the root cause of our unhappiness and lack of peace. Atonement
            for sin brings true joy. Jesus Christ atoned for the sins of the world
            through His death. He is the fountain of perfect love, loving us even in
            our weakness and sinfulness. He is a faithful Savior, waiting for you to
            open your heart to Him.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        That life-changing night, Mohanan sang and prayed to Jesus from the depths
        of his heart. With a renewed passion, he began reading the Bible again,
        starting with the Gospel of Matthew. Though he initially found its
        genealogies tedious, he persisted, and over time, he uncovered profound
        truths hidden in the lists of names.
    </p>

    <p>
        From then on, Mohanan read one book of the Bible every day. No longer was
        it merely “the Christians’ book”—it had become his guide to the living
        God. “The Bible is not just another religious text,” he explained. “It
        reveals Jesus Christ as the only way of salvation for all people. While
        other books are protected by their followers, the Bible is protected by
        God Himself. No other book has faced such relentless opposition and
        criticism, yet it remains the most widely read and distributed book in
        history.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He urged others:
        <em>“Put your heart into reading this Book. It will reveal who you are, who
            Jesus is, the way of salvation, and the destiny of this world. The
            Bible’s message is timeless and life-changing.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>Recalling the story of Nicodemus, Mohanan highlighted Jesus’ words:</p>

    <p class="quotation">
        <em>“Unless you are born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God. Unless
            one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of
            God.”</em>
        (John 3:3-5).
    </p>

    <p>
        He concluded:
        <em>“Every human being must be born again by the Word of God to enter God’s
            kingdom. This spiritual rebirth is the beginning of true peace and
            eternal life.”</em>
    </p>

    <p id="12" class="chapnum">12</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Sharing The Gospel For The First Time</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>hat first prayer of faith in the name of the
        Lord Jesus marked a radical transformation in Mohanan’s life. The change
        was unmistakable. Gone were the restless nights filled with fleeting
        moments of uneasy sleep; in their place was a profound sense of peace,
        joy, and hope that seemed unshakable. He was no longer plagued by despair
        but instead found himself naturally drawn to prayer and songs of praise to
        his Master.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Bible, which had once been a challenging and enigmatic text, now
        unfolded its treasures before him. Many passages that had previously
        seemed obscure became clear, and he began to savor the indescribable
        sweetness of God’s forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        This newfound grace in Mohanan’s life ignited an irrepressible desire to
        share the good news of salvation with others. The words of Jesus echoed in
        his heart: <em>“A lamp is to be put on a lampstand”</em> and,
        <em>“A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.”</em> That very
        morning, an opportunity presented itself when a washerman from his village
        came to visit him.
    </p>
    <p>
        As they talked, Mohanan asked, <em>“Are you familiar with the Bible?”</em>
    </p>
    <p>The man replied, “I have read a little of the New Testament.”</p>
    <p>
        Mohanan eagerly shared his testimony: “Jesus has become my Lord and
        Savior. He has forgiven all my past sins, and now I feel an overwhelming
        sense of peace and joy. There’s hope in my life again. If you turn to Him,
        He can help you overcome smoking, drinking, or anything else that troubles
        you.”
    </p>
    <p>
        This simple, heartfelt declaration became Mohanan’s first gospel message.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reflecting on this, Mohanan later drew inspiration from Jesus’
        conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well. In that moment, the
        Lord had said to her:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, ‘Give me a
        drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living
        water.” (John 4:10).
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan saw parallels between that woman’s longing and the universal human
        condition. People often spend their lives chasing transient
        pleasures—food, drink, and other indulgences—hoping to satisfy an
        unquenchable inner thirst. Yet these cravings only lead to emptiness,
        perpetuating cycles of dissatisfaction and despair.
    </p>
    <p>Jesus had also said:</p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again. But whoever drinks of the
        water I shall give him will never thirst.” (John 4:13-14).
    </p>
    <p>
        For Mohanan, this promise had come alive. His restless soul had been
        calmed, and his deepest thirst had been satisfied by God’s living water.
        He realized that this spiritual nourishment was available to all, freely
        offered by the Creator of life. Only God could deliver humanity from the
        judgment it deserved, and He promised that anyone who sought Him would
        find rivers of living water flowing from their innermost being.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan often pointed to the timeless invitation found in the book of
        Isaiah:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you who have no money,
        come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without
        price. Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and your wages for
        what does not satisfy? Listen diligently to Me, and eat what is good, and
        let your soul delight itself in abundance. Incline your ear and come to
        Me. Hear, and your soul shall live.” (Isaiah 55:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>This gracious call echoes again in the closing pages of the Bible:</p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “Let him who thirsts come. And whoever desires, let him take the water of
        life freely.” (Revelation 22:17).
    </p>
    <p>
        Like the air we all breathe, this life-giving offer is extended to
        everyone—regardless of caste, creed, religion, color, or gender. The
        Saviour of mankind invites all, saying:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and
        believe the gospel.” (Mark 1:15).
    </p>
    <p>And again:</p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
        rest.” (Matthew 11:28).
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan’s transformed life became a testimony to the truth of these words.
        The living water he’d received from Jesus Christ now flowed outward,
        touching others with the hope, peace, and joy that only God can provide.
    </p>

    <p id="13" class="chapnum">13</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Mystery Of The Hereafter</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">F</span>or a few months, Mohanan found a measure of
        peace living in his brother’s house. His elder brother continued to treat
        him with kindness, but the family dynamic began to shift. His
        sister-in-law grew increasingly resentful of his new faith and the added
        strain his presence placed on their time and finances. Her frustrations
        were soon echoed by other family members.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tensions peaked when Mohanan’s father came to visit one day, bringing
        ceremonial water for a puja in honor of a Hindu goddess. Spotting
        Mohanan’s Bible, his father barked at him angrily, “Throw away this book!
        How dare you keep it here?” As he began sprinkling the purification water
        around the house, Mohanan gently attempted to speak to him about Jesus
        Christ. But his words were met with a furious outburst: “You don’t deserve
        to leave your bed ever!”
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite this hostile reaction, Mohanan remained unshaken. The rejection of
        his parents, friends, and even some family members only deepened his
        reliance on the God he’d come to know through the gospel.
    </p>
    <h4>Longing to Understand Life After Death</h4>
    <p>
        For many people, life is an endless pursuit of desires until death, which
        they believe to be the end. Others adopt a fatalistic approach, resigning
        themselves to whatever fate might await them. Mohanan, however, could not
        rest in such uncertainty. His heart longed to understand what truly lay
        beyond the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
        One night, he earnestly prayed to God for insight into life after death.
        That night, he experienced a vivid vision that left a profound impact on
        him.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the vision, Mohanan felt himself being strangled. The pain was sharp
        and intense, and he struggled desperately for breath. Suddenly, his spirit
        left his body, and he became acutely aware of being outside himself. He
        could see his lifeless body from afar, yet his consciousness and identity
        remained intact.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first, there was a brief period of struggle and disorientation, but it
        was soon replaced by an overwhelming sense of peace and serenity. This
        tranquility seemed otherworldly, unlike anything he’d ever experienced
        before. Just as he was beginning to embrace this newfound calm, he awoke
        with a start.
    </p>
    <h4>The Reality of Death and Eternal Life</h4>
    <p>
        Reflecting on the vision, Mohanan felt he’d gained insight into the nature
        of death. He understood why the Bible often describes death as a sleep—a
        period of rest for those who belong to God. The vision also strengthened
        his conviction about the reality of heaven and hell. Death, he realized,
        was not the end but a doorway into eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This experience only deepened his faith. In the face of his family’s
        opposition, he rejoiced in his spirit, confident that the promises of God
        were true.
    </p>
    <h4>An Urgent Plea</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan often shared his newfound understanding with others, saying: “Some
        people deny the reality of God, heaven, and hell. Friends, don’t deceive
        yourselves. True life lies beyond death. Our 70 or 80 years on this earth
        are merely a training period. The Bible reminds us: ‘What is seen is
        temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.’”
    </p>
    <p>
        He often quoted the Apostle Paul’s words from 1 Corinthians to explain the
        mystery of life after death:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        What a foolish question! When you put a seed into the ground, it doesn’t
        grow into a plant unless it dies first. And what you put in the ground is
        not the plant that will grow, but only a bare seed of wheat or whatever
        you are planting. Then God gives it the new body he wants it to have. A
        different plant grows from each kind of seed.
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        Similarly there are different kinds of flesh—one kind for humans, another
        for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. There are also
        bodies in the heavens and bodies on the earth. The glory of the heavenly
        bodies is different from the glory of the earthly bodies. The sun has one
        kind of glory, while the moon and stars each have another kind. And even
        the stars differ from each other in their glory. It is the same way with
        the resurrection of the dead.
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be
        raised to live forever. Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will
        be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised
        in strength. They are buried as natural human bodies, but they will be
        raised as spiritual bodies. For just as there are natural bodies, there
        are also spiritual bodies. (1 Corinthians 15:36-44 NLT).
    </p>
    <p>
        This passage reminded Mohanan of the infinite wisdom of God and the
        profound hope that awaits those who trust in Him. The temporary trials of
        this life, he’d say, pale in comparison to the eternal glory promised to
        God’s children.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Heaven’s Voice At Midnight</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan recalls an incident that occurred
        approximately six months into his stay at his brother’s house. At the
        time, he was undergoing treatment by a traditional medical practitioner,
        or <i>vaidyan</i>, who utilised herbal oils for massage along with other
        natural remedies. The treatment cost about 20 rupees a week—a significant
        sum in those days. However, Mohanan managed to afford it through the
        occasional small gifts he received from friends and neighbours. While the
        therapy yielded no improvement in his paralysis, it did enhance his
        overall health and well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
        One evening, Mohanan noticed that his bottle of massage oil was nearly
        empty. The <i>vaidyan</i> was due to visit in a couple of days, and unless
        he replenished the oil the next day, he’d have to forgo a session or two.
        His brother left for work early in the morning, around 7 a.m., and Mohanan
        realised he needed to secure the funds either that night or very early the
        next day. Trusting in God’s provision, he brought this need before Him in
        prayer that evening. He repeated his petition at about 10 p.m., just
        before settling down to sleep. While Mohanan did not expect money to
        miraculously descend from heaven, he believed that God works through
        people to meet the needs of His children.
    </p>
    <p>
        At midnight, Mohanan was roused from sleep by someone calling his name. To
        his surprise, his friend Johny<i>chayan</i> had come to visit, accompanied
        by his wife. The three of them conversed warmly for over an hour. As they
        prepared to leave, Johny<i>chayan</i> shook hands with Mohanan and
        discreetly pressed a note into his palm. After they departed, Mohanan
        unfolded the note—it was a 20-rupee note!
    </p>
    <p>
        Grateful and overwhelmed, Mohanan reflected on how God had answered his
        prayer in such a timely and precise manner. He sensed God gently reminding
        him,
        <em>“My child, you are limited, but I am not. Day and night exist for you,
            but not for me. Remember, I am always sufficient for all your
            needs.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Being new in his faith, Mohanan’s trust in God was simple and childlike.
        And like a loving Father, God had answered him in the most unexpected of
        ways—at midnight. Only the God of all grace could have prompted Johny<i>chayan</i>
        to visit Mohanan at such an unusual hour, despite the social hesitations
        about disturbing someone’s rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        A gift of 20 rupees may seem trivial by today’s standards, but at that
        time, especially within a poor community, it was a considerable amount.
        Even more remarkable was the exactness of the sum—it was precisely what
        Mohanan needed. Such attentiveness demonstrated the boundless care and
        faithfulness of God in providing for His children.
    </p>
    <p>
        From that moment, Mohanan began to pray in the name of Jesus Christ for
        all his needs, whether spiritual or physical. He took great comfort in the
        promise found in Scripture: “Ask in my (Jesus’) name, and you will
        receive, that your joy may be full.” (John 16:24). Time and again, he
        witnessed God’s provision, reinforcing his conviction that God alone is
        dependable. As the Psalmist declares:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is
        better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.” (Psalm
        118:8–9).

    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Heavenly Lunchbox</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">J</span>esus said to them, ‘I am the bread of life.
        He who comes to me will never hunger, and he who believes in me will never
        thirst.’” These words resonated deeply with Mohanan, and he often quoted
        them with heartfelt conviction. His family, however, would mockingly
        retort, “Well then, you shouldn’t go hungry any more, should you, since
        Jesus is your bread?”
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, his brother and sister-in-law set off to pick cashews on a
        distant plantation, leaving Mohanan behind with just a single <i>dosa</i>.
        It was expected to be midnight before they returned. The children had
        already gone to school with their packed lunches, and the house was
        otherwise empty. This casual neglect left Mohanan feeling dejected, and
        for the first time in a while, he wished more fervently than ever for good
        health and independence.
    </p>
    <p>
        As noon approached, hunger gnawed at him. He bowed his head and prayed
        earnestly, “Lord, I am hungry. Please provide me with food.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Barely five minutes later, he heard footsteps approaching the shed. It was
        Sulochana, his neighbour’s daughter-in-law, carrying a vessel of steaming
        rice along with an array of side dishes—four in all—including hot, crispy
        <i>papads</i>. It was a feast fit for a king. Surprised and touched,
        Mohanan asked, “Sulochana, why have you brought me this food?” She smiled
        shyly and replied, “Oh, I just felt like bringing some to you today.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day followed a similar pattern. After breakfast, the household
        dispersed as usual, leaving Mohanan alone. Once again, hunger began to
        make its presence felt. As if on cue, his aunt’s daughter-in-law arrived
        unannounced, bearing rice and a delicious fish curry—a quintessential
        Malayali dish. It was an unusual gesture, as her family was impoverished
        and rarely had food to spare. She explained, “We cooked extra rice today
        because my mother is visiting us.”
    </p>
    <p>
        On the third day, just as Mohanan wondered how he’d manage, he saw a
        familiar figure approaching the shed. It was his father, balancing two
        pots on his head. Mohanan was astonished, for his father had not visited
        him in nine months. When the pots were opened, they revealed rice and fish
        curry. His father explained that his mother was away visiting relatives,
        so he’d prepared lunch for himself and decided to make some for Mohanan as
        well.
    </p>
    <p>
        For three consecutive days, God provided for Mohanan’s needs, each time
        through a different person who had no idea of his circumstances. It was
        clear to him that God had moved their hearts to act. The same God who
        feeds the baby ravens when they cry had heard his plea.
        <em>“Can a mother forget her child?”</em> God asks in Isaiah.
        <em>“Yes, she may forget, but I will not forget you. I have engraved you on
            the palms of my hands.”</em>
        (Isaiah 49:15–16).
    </p>
    <p>
        Jesus Christ declared, “I am the bread of life; he who comes to me will
        never hunger.” Not only does He nourish the soul, but He also cares for
        our physical needs. Mohanan’s unwavering belief that God would meet his
        every need was rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as God appointed ravens to feed Elijah during a time of famine, He
        remains faithful and fully able to provide for His children. The only
        requirement is trust. Mohanan’s story is a testament to the truth that,
        with God, even the most basic needs—like daily bread—are never overlooked.
    </p>

    <p id="16" class="chapnum">16</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Spiritual Companion</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he Bible foretells a famine:
        <i>“Behold, the days are coming,”</i> says the Lord GOD,
        <i>“that I will send a famine on the land—not a famine of bread, nor a
            thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.”</i>
        This aptly described Mohanan’s state. He hungered and thirsted for
        spiritual truth. Babychayan, who had led him to the Lord, continued to
        visit him weekly to pray with him and teach him more of the Bible. Yet, he
        was unable to answer many of Mohanan’s questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eager to delve deeper into the historical and cultural context of Biblical
        events, Mohanan frequently spent his disability pension of 50 rupees on
        books that illuminated the six thousand years of history underpinning the
        Scriptures. He was fascinated by the kingdoms, empires, and historical
        landscapes that formed the backdrop to the Old and New Testaments.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this time, Johnychayan gave him a booklet titled
        <em>“Who is This Man?”</em> It was written about Jesus Christ by R.
        Krishnankutty Thiruvattar. Until then, Mohanan had naively believed he was
        the only Hindu who had come to faith in Jesus Christ. Thrilled to discover
        otherwise, he read the booklet cover to cover three times. Still thirsty
        for more, he wrote to the publishers, whose address belonged to
        Vijayamohan, a member of a small group of believers called the “Followers
        of Christ Group.”
    </p>
    <p>
        To Mohanan’s delight, Vijayamohan responded, expressing his eagerness to
        meet him. Overjoyed at the prospect of meeting another Hindu follower of
        Christ, Mohanan eagerly awaited the visit. A few days later, Vijayamohan
        travelled 55 kilometres and climbed the hill to Mohanan’s home. When they
        met, they embraced warmly, overwhelmed with joy at finding each other. For
        the first time, Mohanan experienced the shared joy of fellowship with
        someone who understood his spiritual journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, Vijayamohan introduced Mohanan to his pastor, Dennis Sphadikam, and
        other believers who came to visit him. Overnight, it seemed, Mohanan’s
        spiritual family grew, and he found himself surrounded by brothers and
        sisters in faith.
    </p>
    <p>
        Decades later, the bond between Vijayamohan and Mohanan remains as strong
        as ever. Known affectionately as <i>Babuyettan</i> by his friends,
        Vijayamohan is an evangelist who has continuously supported and prayed for
        Mohanan. He played a significant role in Mohanan’s spiritual growth and
        material well-being, introducing him to a wider community of believers.
        Vijayamohan exemplifies the teachings of Jesus, rejoicing with others,
        loving his enemies, praying for his persecutors, returning good for evil,
        and graciously accepting correction when he errs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This first encounter with fellow believers marked the beginning of
        Mohanan’s interactions and correspondence with many Christians and
        servants of God. He also gained access to a treasure trove of Christian
        literature. The challenges he endured while living in his brother’s house
        became tools for God’s discipline, shaping him to grow in maturity and to
        follow in the footsteps of his Master, Jesus Christ. Each trial was
        ultimately for his good, for the Way of the Cross is unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan remains profoundly grateful to his elder brother and his family.
        For two and a half years, they provided him with care, despite their own
        limited means. His brother faithfully helped him bathe daily, treating him
        with the same care as his own children. The young ones adored their uncle
        and assisted him whenever he needed help. Mohanan’s gratitude extends to
        them all, and he prays that God will bless them abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan harbours no bitterness towards his brother or his family. These
        stories are simple accounts of events in his life. As he reflects on his
        journey, he embraces the truth of Romans 8:28:
        <em>“And we know that all things work together for good to those who love
            God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.”</em>

    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Family Restored</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">N</span>early three years had passed since Mohanan’s
        accident, yet he remained separated from his wife and son. Thankamani had
        been living in her family home in Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanan’s first
        sight of his baby son came nine months after his birth. Her family had
        adamantly refused to let her return to him, arguing that he could not
        provide for her. With a baby to care for, Thankamani had no choice but to
        comply.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, Mohanan’s presence in his brother’s home had become a source of
        tension. His sister-in-law frequently complained about the extra work he
        created—washing his clothes, cooking additional meals—and often quarrelled
        with her husband over it. Hearing their arguments, Mohanan’s heart grew
        heavy, and he cried out in prayer, “Father, this is all because of me.
        Please, do something to help.”
    </p>
    <p>
        There were moments when Mohanan wished they would move him
        elsewhere—anywhere, even to the roadside—if only to spare his brother’s
        family the strife. Yet, despite the discord, his brother refused to
        abandon him. Mohanan felt the weight of being an unwelcome guest but could
        do nothing to alter his circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        In time, Thankamani took up manual agricultural labour to support their
        son, Jayaprakash. Occasionally, she’d visit Mohanan under the pretext of
        taking Jayaprakash to the paediatrician in nearby Iritty. Each visit was
        bittersweet. She’d leave in tears, torn between her longing to stay and
        the harsh reality that she could not. Mohanan shared her pain, aching over
        their prolonged separation.
    </p>
    <p>
        He clung to prayer as his lifeline, trusting God to reunite their family.
        Scriptures gave him solace:
        <em>“Cast your burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain you,”</em> and
        <em>Cast all your burdens upon him, for he cares for you.”</em>
        For two and a half years, he prayed steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, doubt often crept in. The devil mocked him, whispering, “What a fool
        you are. Why would she want to live with a man crippled for life? What an
        idiotic prayer! It’s impossible.” But God’s promises strengthened him:
        <em>“With man, this is impossible, but with God, all things are
            possible,”</em>
        and
        <em>“All things are possible to him who believes.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, his prayers were answered in the most unexpected way.
        Thankamani’s neighbour, a respected Catholic woman affectionately called
        “Teacher,” intervened. She advised Thankamani’s parents not to keep
        husband and wife apart. Her brothers, too, supported her. “It’s not right
        to separate them,” they said.
    </p>

    <img src="./img/057-eng.webp" alt="" />

    <p>
        Moved by their appeals, her brothers decided to build a small house for
        Thankamani on her share of the family property. This modest home, located
        in Ayyankunnu—a hilly area about 12 kilometres from Koottupuzha on the
        Kerala-Karnataka border—became a place where Mohanan and his family could
        finally live together.
    </p>
    <p>
        What had once seemed impossible became reality, and Mohanan’s faith was
        vindicated. Through God’s grace and the kindness of others, his family was
        restored, and his prayers were answered in full.
    </p>

    <p id="18" class="chapnum">18</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Preeminence Of God In Faith And Family</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>his welcome news reached Mohanan at a time
        when he was becoming increasingly disheartened by his circumstances in his
        brother’s house. One day, Thankamani paid him an unexpected visit to share
        the developments. Mohanan’s heart overflowed with joy as he saw evidence
        of God’s hand at work even amidst his challenges. Within a few months,
        Thankamani’s new house was completed, and her brothers were prepared to
        help her family move in.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there was a catch. Thankamani’s brothers laid down a condition:
        “Tell your husband to stop these Bible readings and renounce his faith in
        Jesus Christ if he wants to live in this house.”
    </p>
    <p>
        When Thankamani reluctantly conveyed this ultimatum to Mohanan, his heart
        burned with love for his Lord, reminiscent of King David’s devotion.
        Outwardly, the decision might have seemed agonising. For years, he’d
        longed to reunite with his wife and son. Now, he’d the opportunity to live
        with them in their own home. Was his faith in Christ worth risking this
        chance? Could his relationship with the Saviour be weighed against the
        love of his family and the comfort of an independent life?
    </p>
    <p>
        The words of the Lord echoed in his mind: “If anyone comes to Me and does
        not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters,
        yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple” (Luke 14:26).
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan had already been disowned by his parents for the sake of his
        faith. Now, it appeared that his commitment might cost him his family and
        a home. Yet Mohanan did not hesitate. He required neither fasting nor
        extended prayer to discern the right course of action. He told Thankamani
        firmly, “Your choice is your own, but no one can compel me to abandon
        Jesus, the Saviour of my soul, who rescued me from the depths of despair.
        Even if it means living alone for the rest of my life, I’ll never deny my
        Lord and my God.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Reflecting on this decision many years later, Mohanan said, “Today, I
        understand the value of the choice I made back then. It was purely by His
        grace that I stood firm. Luke 14:26, 27, and 33 reveal the cost of
        discipleship: ‘If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and
        mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life
        also, he cannot be My disciple. And whoever does not bear his cross and
        come after Me cannot be My disciple. So likewise, whoever of you does not
        forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple.’ These truths should be
        emphasised in our churches, but sadly, they are often downplayed.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Anyone who desires to follow Christ must place Him first in their life.
        For many Christians, this place is occupied by houses, families, finances,
        careers, social status, or prestige. Such priorities hinder them from
        becoming true disciples. Only when Christ is given the pre-eminent place
        in our lives can we experience His tender care and sustaining grace.”
    </p>
    <p>
        After praying with Thankamani, Mohanan conveyed his response to her
        brothers: “Jesus comes first in my life. What you do with the house is
        entirely up to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Thankamani left in tears, struggling to comprehend his stance. Her
        brothers, enraged by his decision, issued a dire threat: “We’ll burn you
        alive in the house if you persist in this stubbornness!”
    </p>
    <img src="./img/060-eng.webp" alt="" />
    <p>
        Yet, against all odds, Mohanan and his family remain alive and joyful to
        this day. In time, Thankamani’s brothers relented for her sake, and the
        small family moved into the new house.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before this resolution, however, another significant matter needed to be
        addressed. One day, Mohanan received a visit from a brother with a
        prophetic gift. This visitor had been given a vision to share with
        Mohanan, revealing certain sins and weaknesses, particularly the lingering
        anger Mohanan harboured towards his parents. The Lord had shown the
        visitor Mohanan’s angry outbursts during his past emotional and mental
        struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Human anger, the visitor explained, obstructs the revelation of God’s
        righteousness. For God’s children to experience His blessings, they must
        let go of anger. Mohanan recognised this as a divine message. The Bible’s
        command was clear: “Honour your father and mother, that it may be well
        with you and that you may live long on the earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan invited his parents to visit him. Though hesitant at first, they
        eventually agreed. When they arrived, Mohanan humbled himself, apologising
        for his past outbursts and asking for their forgiveness. Like a child, he
        rested his head on his father’s lap, weeping and seeking their blessing.
        His father responded, “You’ll never be in want of anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Through this act of reconciliation, Mohanan learned a profound truth:
        those who surrender to God’s Word will be blessed. Such individuals are
        prepared to obey His commands, knowing that He will never require anything
        beyond their ability to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, it is lamentable that many sons and daughters choose to place their
        ageing parents in care homes, perceiving them as burdens. These children,
        often living abroad and enjoying successful careers, leave their parents
        to fend for themselves. Tragically, they may face similar abandonment in
        their own later years.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Christians, we are called to obey God’s command to honour our parents,
        ensuring a long and fulfilling life. True honour goes beyond financial
        support; it acknowledges the immense debt of love and care owed to those
        who sacrificed so much to nurture us. If we claim to love God, let us
        demonstrate it by keeping His commands—including the command to honour our
        parents.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Momentous Encounter With God’s Spirit</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he final month of 1989 was a sorrowful one
        for many around the globe. Yet, for Mohanan, it marked a deeply
        transformative chapter. Just days earlier, he’d been visited by a
        venerable woman, approximately 70 years old, whose demeanour radiated
        grace and spirituality. Her face bore the unmistakeable mark of one deeply
        in communion with the Holy Spirit. A wise teacher, a devoted wife, and a
        loving mother, she exuded an aura of holiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        During their conversation, she asked him, “Son, have you received the Holy
        Spirit?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan replied, somewhat perplexed, “I don’t quite understand what you
        mean. I was saved two and a half years ago, but I’ve never encountered
        that idea before.”
    </p>
    <p>
        She gently encouraged him to seek the filling of the Spirit, which God
        promises to all believers. They prayed together, and she left. But her
        words lingered in his mind, compelling him to delve into the Scriptures—a
        habit that had become second nature since his rebirth in faith.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Mohanan explored the Gospel of John, he encountered numerous references
        to the Holy Spirit. In John 14:16–17, Jesus promises:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that
        He may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world
        cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him. But ye know
        Him, for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.”
    </p>
    <p>
        These words puzzled him. If the disciples, who had walked with Jesus for
        years, were being promised the Spirit, what did this mean for believers
        who assumed that the filling of the Spirit occurred at the moment of
        salvation?
    </p>
    <h4>Seeking the Spirit’s Power</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan realised he yearned for the Spirit’s power in his life. Living at
        the time with his brother’s family, he set aside a day for fasting and
        prayer. That evening, around six o’clock, he fervently asked God for the
        gift of the Holy Spirit, longing to be led by the Comforter. What followed
        was a profound spiritual awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
        As he prayed, he experienced a deep conviction of his sins and
        shortcomings. Despite his dedication to reading and reflecting on holy
        living, his life fell far short of the ideal. He recognised his pride and
        fear—particularly his apprehension about praying in tongues, lest others
        mock him. These revelations broke him, and he wept bitterly, mourning his
        disobedience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, his prayers transformed. Unfamiliar words poured forth, as
        though from a source beyond himself. It felt as if waves of electricity
        coursed through his being. As he continued praying in this unknown tongue,
        Mohanan experienced an indescribable joy and an overwhelming sense of
        divine presence. The warmth that enveloped him extended even to his
        perpetually cold toes—a sensation he later likened to the “baptism of
        fire” described in Matthew 3:11.
    </p>
    <p>
        His young nieces and nephews, alarmed by his fervour, began to cry,
        jolting him back to the physical world. To his astonishment, over two
        hours had passed.
    </p>
    <h4>A Transformed Life</h4>
    <p>
        The experience profoundly changed him. He shed his timidity in sharing the
        Gospel and became humbler in spirit. His perspective on life and faith was
        entirely renewed. Above all, he found grace and strength to face every
        circumstance.
    </p>
    <h4>The Controversy Surrounding the Spirit</h4>
    <p>
        The filling or anointing of the Holy Spirit has long been a topic of
        debate, with interpretations varying across churches. Some associate it
        with outward displays such as loud utterances or speaking in tongues, yet
        their lives often lack the fruits of the Spirit—humility, holiness, and
        love. Others dismiss spiritual gifts altogether, claiming they ceased with
        the apostolic age. However, this contradicts passages like 1 Corinthians
        14:39–40:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with
        tongues. Let all things be done decently and in order.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan concluded that spiritual gifts remain active as long as the Church
        endures. Yet these gifts are not ends in themselves but tools for service
        and edification.
    </p>
    <h4>The Progressive Filling of the Spirit</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan likened the filling of the Spirit to water in a container: “As
        spiritual infants, a cupful suffices. But as we mature, we need
        increasingly larger measures—like a bucket, a well, or even a mighty
        river—to sustain and share the fullness of the Gospel.”
    </p>
    <p>
        He also pointed to the example of David, anointed three times, each
        marking a new phase of his calling. Similarly, Ezekiel’s vision of the
        stream symbolised the Spirit’s increasing influence, from ankle-deep
        waters to an all-encompassing river.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, Mohanan emphasised that true Spirit-led living means yielding
        entirely to God’s will. The more we yield to God’s rule in our life, the
        more we are “filled” in the Spirit. This is akin to being carried by a
        river, fully surrendered to its flow.
    </p>

    <h4>Empowered by the Spirit</h4>
    <p>
        Filled with the Spirit, Mohanan became part of a divine mission to reflect
        Christ’s image. He emphasised that true spiritual empowerment produces the
        fruit of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, and other virtues (Galatians
        5:22–23). It also equips believers to fulfil God’s purpose with boldness
        and humility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan’s story is a testament to the transformative power of the Holy
        Spirit—a power that enables ordinary people to live extraordinary lives of
        faith, humility, and service. He urges believers to rely on the Spirit for
        discernment and to reject superstitions and false teachings.

        Life at Palathinkadavu: A Trial of Faith and Resilience
    </h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan and his family settled into a modest
        house in
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>, their third relocation in the three years since his life-altering
        accident. Perched on the side of a mountain, the house was isolated,
        accessible only by a steep climb from a drop-off point two kilometres
        away. The nearest road lay ten kilometres distant, and a single,
        unreliable all-terrain taxi service operated in the area, subject to both
        the vehicle’s condition and the whims of its driver.
    </p>
    <p>
        The challenges of living in the Western Ghats, which form the northeastern
        boundary of Kerala, were manifold. The closest school, post office, and
        shop were eight kilometres away in Kacherikadavu. Basic provisions,
        including essentials like salt, were unavailable locally. The family
        relied on subsidised or free rations from the government’s public
        distribution system, but the outlet was also in Kacherikadavu. With the
        taxi service so undependable, Thankamani often undertook exhausting treks
        to town, carrying heavy groceries on the return journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        The house was surrounded on three sides by the dense rainforests of Kerala
        and Karnataka, and below flowed the Barapol River, the last tributary of
        the Vallapattanam River. Nights in this wilderness echoed with the
        chilling sounds of wild animals. Wild elephants were a constant threat,
        and Mohanan once lay helpless on his cot while these colossal creatures
        ventured perilously close—just two houses away.
    </p>
    <p>
        Life in
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>
        was primitive and demanding. Days were short, with the sun rising at 8
        a.m. and disappearing behind the peaks by 4 p.m.. The family had few
        conveniences beyond essential utensils. Yet, amidst the hardship, they
        were blessed with unpolluted air and pristine water, a stark contrast to
        the turmoil they endured daily.
    </p>
    <h4>Trials of Faith</h4>
    <p>
        Thankamani bore the brunt of these struggles, both physically and
        mentally. While she’d long yearned for the family to reunite, life in
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>
        must have felt like leaping from the frying pan into the fire. To sustain
        the family, she worked as a daily labourer in nearby fields, earning a
        pittance. After a gruelling day’s work, she’d return home to shoulder
        household responsibilities, care for Mohanan, and tend to their young son.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding to her burdens was the antagonism of her brothers, staunch members
        of the
        <span class="bold emphasis"><a id="ref006" href="#fn006">Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</a></span>
        (RSS), a militant Hindu organisation. They resented Mohanan’s conversion
        to Christianity. While they grudgingly helped the family move into the
        house, they soon distanced themselves, explicitly stating that Thankamani
        should not expect any support from them. Attempts to sway Mohanan back to
        Hinduism ranged from debates and persuasion to promises of providing
        religious texts like the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> and the <i>Ramayana</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan, however, stood firm in his faith. His reply to their overtures
        was resolute: “I’ll stop reading the Bible and renounce my faith in Jesus
        if you can guarantee one thing—that I’ll still have the assurance that my
        sins are forgiven, and the same joy, peace, and eternal hope I have now.
        Can you promise that?” Their answer was unequivocal: “That’s impossible!”
    </p>
    <p>
        On the day of their arrival, one brother questioned Mohanan’s choice: “Why
        do you need to serve Jesus? Don’t we Hindus have enough gods?”
    </p>
    <p>“Plenty,” Mohanan replied, “but none that can save.”</p>
    <p>
        The brother attempted a compromise: “Believe in Jesus if you must, but
        keep it to yourself. Don’t let others know.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognising the temptation to hide his faith, Mohanan was ready with
        Scripture:
    </p>
    <p>
        “<em>A lamp is not lit to be hidden under a cover but placed on a stand to
            give light to everyone in the house. A city on a hill cannot be
            hidden</em>. It is God’s command that I share the truth I have come to know. I can’t
        help sharing it.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Infuriated, the brother shouted, “You’re shaming our family!
        <i>Ayyappan</i>
        himself will take revenge!” Storming out, he vowed never to return.
    </p>
    <p>
        With characteristic humour, Mohanan quipped, “The door will always be open
        to you—after all, we don’t even have a door. Come whenever you like.”
    </p>
    <p>
        One by one, Thankamani’s relatives distanced themselves from the family.
        But Mohanan remained unwavering, comforted by God’s promise:
        <em>“I’ll never leave you nor forsake you. Be strong and courageous. Fear
            not, nor be dismayed.”</em>
    </p>
    <h4>Sustained by Faith</h4>
    <p>
        Thankamani’s brothers made it clear they would provide no assistance as
        long as Mohanan remained a Christian. Determined not to depend on them,
        Mohanan told Thankamani, “Never ask them for help, even if it means going
        without essentials. I know my God will provide. We won’t be a burden to
        anyone, nor will we borrow—especially from your family.” This principle
        became a cornerstone of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the challenges, God provided for them throughout their three years
        at
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>. Thankamani worked tirelessly to make ends meet, while Mohanan deepened
        his relationship with God through prayer, worship, and studying Scripture.
        This time of solitude allowed him to discern God’s will with greater
        clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, even the estranged relatives began visiting again. Mohanan and
        Thankamani received them warmly, offering hot tea and whatever simple
        snacks they had. Revenge was never on their minds, for they embraced the
        Biblical teaching to overcome evil with good.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking back, Mohanan is filled with gratitude for God’s faithfulness.
        Though his eldest brother-in-law succumbed to lung cancer at the age of
        forty-five, Mohanan continues to live a life of purpose, bearing fruit for
        the Lord. Glory be to God!
    </p>

    <hr />
    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="21" class="chapnum">21</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Provision Through Prayer</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">W</span>ith each passing day, Mohanan grew stronger
        in his hope and trust in God. As he reflected on the challenges he’d
        faced, a desire stirred within him to document his experiences. He hoped
        his story would inspire and comfort others navigating life’s hardships. He
        began writing on a few pages torn from an old diary, but it wasn’t long
        before he ran out of space.
    </p>
    <p>
        The realization dawned on him: completing this task would require far more
        paper than he’d at hand. Asking Thankamani to make the arduous journey to
        Kacherikadavu to purchase more was an option, but it posed a significant
        challenge. The trip was time-consuming and physically taxing, and their
        finances were already stretched thin. Thankamani’s meager earnings barely
        covered their daily needs, including the medicines Mohanan required for
        his recurring bedsores and urinary infections.
    </p>
    <p>
        As he considered the situation, Mohanan remembered a simple yet profound
        truth—<em>he could bring his needs to God</em>. Like a child with
        unwavering trust, he prayed, asking for just four sheets of writing paper.
    </p>
    <h4>An Unlikely Answer</h4>
    <p>
        Not long before this, Mandapathil Mathew, a local village council member,
        had visited Mohanan. Meanwhile, Mohanan’s elder brother, planning to visit
        him the following day, stopped by a shop in Koottupuzha to buy a few
        treats for the visit. By chance—or divine orchestration—Mathew was at the
        same shop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hearing of the planned visit, Mathew found himself wondering,
        <em>What could I send to Mohanan that might bring him some joy?</em> On an
        impulse, he purchased a quire of ruled paper—a completely uncharacteristic
        gift in Mohanan’s culture, where visitors to the sick typically brought
        snacks or small monetary gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the paper arrived, Mohanan was overjoyed. He quickly filled the
        sheets with his testimony, recounting how God had faithfully guided and
        provided for him through many trials. To him, the gift of paper was not
        just an act of kindness but a direct answer to his prayer.
    </p>
    <h4>God’s Perfect Provision</h4>
    <p>
        Reflecting on the experience, Mohanan saw the truth of Scripture come to
        life: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the LORD, like the rivers of
        water; He turns it wherever He wishes.”
    </p>
    <p>
        This small but significant act reinforced Mohanan’s faith. It reminded
        him—and all who heard his story—that God is intimately involved in the
        lives of His children, providing for their needs when they place their
        trust in Him.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="22" class="chapnum">22</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Lessons in Obedience and Trust</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">B</span>efore his accident, Mohanan once travelled
        with a few others in a “jeep,” an all-terrain two-door wagon. Among them
        was a man named Raghavan, who was intoxicated and quickly took offence at
        Mohanan over some trivial matter. Raghavan’s insults escalated until he
        began to hurl abuse at Mohanan’s mother. Mohanan, though initially
        restraining his irritation, eventually lost his temper. A fight ensued,
        and Raghavan ended up in the gutter!
    </p>
    <p>
        Years later, as Mohanan reflected on his life, the Spirit brought this
        incident back to his mind. Deeply convicted, he felt the need to seek
        Raghavan’s forgiveness. Mohanan sent him a message requesting a visit.
        Raghavan, accompanied by his wife Narayani, came to see him. Both were
        basket-makers by trade. To Mohanan’s surprise, Raghavan had no memory of
        the altercation. Nevertheless, Mohanan humbly and tearfully asked for his
        forgiveness. Moved by his sincerity, the couple reassured him that no harm
        had been done and comforted him.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a gesture of goodwill, they gave him one of their layer hens. Mohanan
        saw this as a lesson: when we obey the Lord and risk losing face, we gain
        a spiritual victory over the enemy and receive honour from God.
    </p>
    <h4>A Growing Flock</h4>
    <p>
        The hen soon laid eggs, which were brooded by another hen belonging to one
        of Thankamani’s brothers. Within a short time, Mohanan found himself with
        ten chicks. However, the brood hen began to crow like a rooster, which
        Thankamani’s brother took as an ill omen. Without hesitation, he wrung the
        bird’s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan now faced the challenge of raising the chicks himself. He placed
        them in a large basket and prayed for divine protection from predators—be
        they snakes, mongooses, or hawks. Though it might seem childish or
        laughable to some, God heard his prayer. Not a single chick was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        In time, Mohanan had a thriving flock of eight hens and two cockerels. His
        father-in-law built a coop for him, and with no nearby market to sell the
        eggs, the family enjoyed a plentiful supply.
    </p>
    <h4>A Lesson in Generosity</h4>
    <p>
        The abundance of eggs brought back memories of a time when Mohanan lived
        with his brother. He recalled overhearing his sister-in-law telling her
        children to eat their eggs quickly so she wouldn’t have to share any with
        him. Back then, he’d often longed for the eggs he could no longer afford
        but had once bought freely through his own hard work. Now, with eggs in
        abundance, he realised he no longer craved them.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the eggs stirred a different kind of greed in him. One day,
        Thankamani’s mother came to borrow an egg to prepare a medicinal remedy
        for her son. Reluctant to part with the eggs, Mohanan grudgingly gave her
        two after Thankamani insisted. Later, during his prayer time, he felt a
        deep conviction. It was as if God reminded him that the hens, and their
        eggs, were divine gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the eggs stirred a different kind of greed in him. One day,
        Thankamani’s mother came to borrow an egg to prepare a medicinal remedy

        two after Thankamani insisted. Later, during his prayer time, he felt a
        deep conviction. It was as if God reminded him that the hens, and their
        eggs, were divine gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ashamed, Mohanan sent his young son to fetch Thankamani’s mother. When she
        returned, he held her hand and confessed his selfishness. “Amma, these
        eggs are from God. Please take all of them and use them for your son.”
        Bewildered, she insisted she needed only one, but Mohanan explained that
        his apology was not about the eggs but about his attitude. Finally, she
        said, “I forgive you.”
    </p>
    <p>
        This moment taught Mohanan the importance of obeying God’s command: “Love
        your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you.”
        For Mohanan, seeking forgiveness—no matter how trivial the offence—was a
        way to ensure he remained in God’s favour and blessing.
    </p>
    <h4>A Matter of Integrity</h4>
    <p>
        In another incident, Thankamani was shopping in Kacherikadavu, eight
        kilometres from their home. At the ration shop, the shopkeeper mistakenly
        returned two extra rupees with her change. Thankamani only noticed the
        error after she got home. When Mohanan learned of it, he urged her to
        return the money immediately, but she was reluctant to make the arduous
        journey back.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following week, the shopkeeper mistakenly gave her ten rupees too
        much. This time, Mohanan insisted the money be returned. “That poor
        shopkeeper earns just eighteen rupees on a sack of rice,” he said. “You
        have twelve rupees of his with you. Please return it, or I won’t be able
        to eat anything until you do.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the embarrassment of confessing the error, Thankamani agreed. When
        she returned the money and explained the mistake, the shopkeeper was
        astonished by her honesty and treated her with great respect from then on.
        This small act reaffirmed Mohanan’s belief in the biblical principle: “The
        kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and
        joy in the Holy Spirit.” (Romans 14:17).
    </p>
    <h4>Trusting God’s Promises</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan shares these stories to encourage those who are struggling with
        poverty, debt, or other hardships. He reminds us of God’s countless
        promises in Scripture, all of which are fulfilled when we meet the
        conditions. “Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all
        these things shall be added to you.” (Matthew 6:33).
    </p>
    <p>
        To seek God’s kingdom means to trust Him and keep His commandments. True
        worship isn’t about bargaining with God for blessings but about turning to
        Him in faith and obedience. As Mohanan learned, when we trust and obey,
        God provides for every need in His perfect time.

            Palathinkadavu</a>, a torrential rainstorm swept through the area. Mohanan, as was his
        custom, spent his mornings in prayer, singing, reading, and studying the
        Bible while his wife was away at work. On this particular day, the rain
        seeped freely into their hut through the aged, dry thatch, which was
        riddled with gaps.
    </p>
    <p>He recalls:</p>
    <p class="indented">
        “Without a wheelchair, I was confined to bed all day. As the rainwater
        began dripping onto my bed, I rolled my mattress closer to me, trying to
        avoid the leaks as they multiplied. Finally, I found myself lying on a
        small dry patch with the mattress rolled up beneath me. I hoped
        desperately that this spot would stay dry for at least a while longer.
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
        “But the situation worsened. A section of the roof above me gave way, and
        a torrent of water poured directly onto me and the mattress, soaking both
        completely. I could not lie on the bare wooden planks for fear of
        developing bedsores, but now I had no choice but to wait for my mattress
        to dry. Wet, cold, and helpless, I prayed through my tears:
        <em>‘Lord, it is Your will that I am paralysed. If I could repair this roof
            myself, I would’ve done so long ago. Please, Father, provide tiles so we
            can have a proper roof.’</em>
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
        “As I prayed, a sense of peace filled me. I waited for my wife to return,
        so she could lay out the mattress, sheets, and everything else to dry. In
        the meantime, I made do with a grass mat.
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
        “The next day, around noon, my brother arrived unexpectedly with some
        wonderful news. A tea estate owner in a place called Peratta had offered
        to help me with a gift of 2,000 rupees. He had instructed my brother to
        ask whether I wanted a cow, roof tiles, or anything else I needed.
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
        “Without hesitation, I requested 800 roof tiles. With the remaining funds,
        I ordered 40 clay trellises, or <i>jaalis</i>, to replace windows and
        provide light and ventilation for our home. Within 24 hours of my prayer,
        God had met my need. My heart overflowed with joy at this fresh evidence
        of His provision.
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
        “What was even more astonishing was the involvement of my eldest
        brother-in-law, who had been hostile towards me in the past. He
        volunteered to oversee the entire project. Even he could not deny the
        reality of God’s mercy. <em>How great is our God!</em>
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
        “I immediately thought of Psalm 145:8:
        <em>‘The Lord is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and great
            in mercy.’</em>
        Another verse came to mind: ‘The sacrifices of God are
        <em>a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart</em>—these, O God, You
        will not despise.’ (Psalm 51:17).
    </p>
    <h4>The Power of Persistent Prayer</h4>
    <p>
        “In Mark 10:46, we read of Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, who cried out to
        Jesus, <em>‘Son of David, have mercy on me!’</em> The crowd rebuked him,
        but Bartimaeus shouted even louder. When Jesus heard his cries, He stopped
        and called for him, healing him instantly. This story reminds us that the
        Lord hears all who call upon Him in faith: ‘But know that the Lord has set
        apart for Himself him who is godly; the Lord will hear when I call to
        Him.’ (Psalm 4:3).
    </p>
    <p>
        “My prayer for a roof was answered the very moment I cried out, even
        though the news reached me the following day. Similarly, in the book of
        Daniel, God granted an answer on the first day of Daniel’s prayer, yet it
        was delayed for 21 days. Perseverance in prayer is vital because God
        always answers in His perfect timing.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Whatever your struggle, cry out to the Lord with faith. True prayer often
        comes when we hit rock bottom. The God of all compassion does not ignore
        our tears. When Jesus encountered the grieving widow of Nain, He said to
        her, ‘Do not weep,’ before raising her son from the dead. He says the same
        to us because He has the power to remove the cause of our sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        “In the parable of the persistent widow and the unjust judge (Luke
        18:1-8), we see a woman who, through her unrelenting pleas, compels the
        judge to act. Jesus assures us: ‘Shall God not avenge His own elect who
        cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them? I tell you
        that He will avenge them speedily.’
    </p>
    <h4>The Example of Christ</h4>
    <p>
        “During His time on earth, Jesus lived a life of perfect holiness. Though
        He faced every human temptation, He remained sinless in thought, word, and
        deed. How did He achieve this? Through constant prayer. The writer of
        Hebrews tells us:
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “‘In the days of His flesh, He offered up prayers and supplications, with
        vehement cries and tears, to Him who was able to save Him from death, and
        was heard because of His godly fear.’ (Hebrews 5:7).
    </p>
    <p>
        “Jesus was not afraid of suffering or death. He foretold His crucifixion
        and resurrection, saying, ‘The Son of Man must suffer many things... and
        be killed, and be raised the third day.’ (Luke 9:22). But He prayed
        earnestly to be kept from sin, knowing that even the smallest
        transgression would mean Satan’s victory and eternal dominion over
        creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        “As Christians, we fail to live victoriously over sin because we don’t
        seek God’s help with the same urgency. In times of danger or crisis, we
        cry out for help without hesitation. How much <em>more</em> should we
        plead for God’s grace to overcome sin?
    </p>
    <p>
        “Scripture is filled with accounts of how God answered the prayers of His
        people—Abraham, Moses, Samuel, David, Daniel, and many others. These
        examples should inspire us to humble ourselves and become men and women of
        prayer. Prayer remains the greatest force on earth, and through it, God’s
        power is revealed.”

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Impeccable Integrity</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">O</span>ne day, Mohanan sent a neighbour’s child on
        an errand, lending him an umbrella for the trip. Unfortunately, the child
        mislaid it and returned without it. The following day, Thankamani went to
        town to buy groceries. Upon her return, she exclaimed, “God has given me
        back my lost umbrella!”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan, intrigued, replied, “Let me see whether this is God’s umbrella or
        Satan’s.” He examined it carefully and noticed the name Cheruvari Vinod
        inscribed on the inside. Recognising the name, Mohanan realised it
        belonged to a neighbour from Koottupuzha, his parents’ village.
    </p>
    <p>
        “This umbrella <em>must</em> be returned,” Mohanan insisted. “We can send
        it back with the bus conductor or return it ourselves.” Since Koottupuzha
        was twelve kilometres away, they decided to send a letter informing Vinod
        of the umbrella’s whereabouts and later entrusted it to Mohanan’s brother
        during his next visit to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan reflected, <em>Christ’s disciples must never act dishonestly</em>.
        Taking what belongs to another, making dishonest gains, or engaging in
        similar conduct is unworthy of a child of God.
    </p>
    <h4>A Hidden Sin and Its Effects</h4>
    <p>
        In another incident, Thankamani’s father discovered a can of liquor hidden
        in tall grass while mowing his field. It was likely left there by a
        bootlegger. He decided to claim it for himself, stuffing it into a bundle
        of grass and taking it home to enjoy his unexpected find.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the next three days, the five-litre can was emptied. Once it was
        finished, he thought it might be useful to Thankamani and gave her the can
        to store kerosene. By then, Mohanan had heard the story of how the can had
        been found, but he didn’t think there was anything wrong with accepting it
        in its empty state.
    </p>
    <p>
        That night, however, Mohanan felt an unusual lack of power in his prayers.
        Over the following weeks, the family encountered a series of problems:
        Thankamani was cheated out of her wages by her employer, they struggled to
        obtain their rice ration, and a pervasive sense of unease settled over
        their home.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan prayed earnestly for clarity regarding the root cause of these
        troubles. During his prayer, he saw a vision of a white can falling from
        the ceiling with great force, piercing through the bed and continuing
        downward. He understood at once that the liquor can, which had been stolen
        property, was the source of their distress.
    </p>
    <p>
        He told Thankamani, “We <em>must</em> get rid of this stolen can. It will
        continue to bring harm as long as it remains in our home.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Though Thankamani did not fully agree with him, she respected his
        convictions. She quietly returned the can to her parents’ house without
        further discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        From that moment, things began to improve. Their prayers were unhindered,
        and peace returned to their home.
    </p>
    <h4>The Weight of Sin</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan reflected on the lesson they had learned.
        <i>“Dead flies putrefy the perfumer’s ointment and cause it to give off a
            foul odour; so does a little folly to one respected for wisdom and
            honour.”</i>
        (Ecclesiastes 10:1). Greed, theft, and dishonesty hinder God’s blessings
        in our lives. No matter the cost, it is always best to rid ourselves of
        such things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Too often, people hold onto what is not rightfully theirs—whether it be
        dishonest gains, bribes, tax evasion, or lost property. These are not
        blessings; they are curses. Any wealth or possession acquired through
        cheating or dishonesty will ultimately vanish, but what is earned honestly
        will flourish.
        <i>“The blessing of the Lord makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow with
            it.”</i>
        (Proverbs 10:22).
    </p>
    <p>
        The story of Achan in the seventh chapter of <i>Joshua</i> serves as a
        stark warning. Achan secretly kept loot from the city of Jericho, which
        was devoted to destruction by God’s command. His actions brought death and
        defeat, not only to himself but also to his family and the entire nation
        of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
        “When we do wrong,” Mohanan observed, “the first impact is on ourselves,
        but it eventually affects our families, our local church, and even the
        wider church community.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the Law of Moses, every sin was punished without mercy. Under the
        new covenant, the standard remains high:
        <em>“Be holy, for I am holy.”</em> (1 Peter 1:16). We are instructed,
    </p>
    <p class="quotation">
        “Touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you. I will be a father
        to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
        Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
        all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of
        God.” (2 Corinthians 6:17–7:1).
    </p>
    <h4>The Danger of “Small” Sins</h4>
    <p>
        A small break in a wire disrupts the flow of electrical current.
        Similarly, seemingly insignificant sins can obstruct the flow of grace in
        our lives. Just as a small cloud can obscure the sun, even the smallest
        sin separates us from God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adam’s disobedience, stemming from a moment of unbelief, brought a curse
        upon humanity. Cain’s sin cursed the ground itself. These examples remind
        us that no sin, however small, is trivial in God’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>Mohanan concluded:</p>
    <p>
        “May God grant us the light to recognise every sin in our lives, even the
        ones we deem insignificant. Sin separates us from God, and this is why so
        many of our prayers go unanswered. Let us confess and forsake our sins and
        seek cleansing through the blood of Jesus Christ.”
    </p>

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Faith, Perseverance, and God’s Provision</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Mohanan lived with his brother, he’d
        bathe outdoors in the courtyard. However, at
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>, it was impossible for Thankamani to assist him with such baths. Without
        help, he went several weeks without bathing. Eventually, he asked her to
        request her brother’s assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thankamani’s brother agreed and helped Mohanan to sit on a chair in the
        yard so he could bathe himself. However, when Mohanan finished, his calls
        for help to return to his bed went unanswered. He sat on the chair for
        three hours before the man finally returned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking the hint, and recognising the disdain her family held for Mohanan’s
        faith, the couple decided not to rely on them again. Mohanan resolved to
        manage with sponge baths for the rest of his life, if necessary, rather
        than give up his faith in the God who had forgiven his sins.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the next six months, he used a damp washcloth to clean himself, with
        Thankamani helping him scrub his back. By God’s grace, his skin remained
        clean and healthy throughout this time.
    </p>
    <h4>A Brother’s Selfless Love</h4>
    <p>
        One day, a man named Abraham arrived at their home. Abraham was a former
        banker, holding a master’s degree, who had left his career to serve as an
        evangelist in Kiliyanthara. He had heard about Mohanan from Vijayamohan
        and walked twelve kilometres uphill to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two bonded instantly, sharing spiritual truths and songs. Moved by
        their connection, Mohanan asked Abraham if he could help him bathe.
        Abraham was more than willing and began visiting weekly to assist. Each
        visit followed a pattern: Abraham would rest briefly after his long walk,
        drinking a glass of plain water, and then help Mohanan bathe. They would
        pray together, share fellowship, and Abraham would leave with 20 rupees to
        support Mohanan’s needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This arrangement continued for eighteen months, during which Abraham
        faithfully walked the long distance to serve his brother. On his final
        visit, before being transferred to a distant location, Abraham handed
        Mohanan 130 rupees—a tithe of his income during their time together.
        Mohanan was deeply moved to learn that Abraham had saved this money by
        giving up one meal a day, living on a meagre income of 400 rupees a month.
        His sacrificial love left an indelible mark on Mohanan’s heart.
    </p>
    <h4>God’s Unexpected Provision</h4>
    <p>
        After Abraham’s departure, Mohanan wondered how he’d manage without the
        weekly help. To his astonishment, a few brothers from the Kannur Brethren
        Church gifted him a wheelchair. This thoughtful gesture included
        contributors like Poulose Thudien, C. I. Samuel, and John Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
        A ramp was soon added to their house, enabling Mohanan to bathe outside
        with minimal assistance. The wheelchair also became his workspace,
        allowing him to build a wall around the compound and weave plastic
        baskets. Each basket took three days to complete and sold for five rupees.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the monsoon season, when fieldwork was impossible, Mohanan sold 20
        rupees’ worth of baskets to a nearby convent. The sisters distributed
        wheat and oil at subsidised rates to the poor, so Thankamani decided to
        make a purchase. Mohanan added rice and lentils to the list for their son,
        who digested rice better than wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thankamani collected the payment for the baskets and bought provisions,
        including five kilograms of wheat semolina and one litre of oil for six
        rupees. She also bought additional wheat and oil for neighbours. However,
        a neighbour, Molly, asked to borrow two rupees, leaving Thankamani unable
        to buy the rice and lentils.
    </p>
    <p>
        When she returned without them, Mohanan, disappointed, remarked, “You’ve
        forgotten even our little boy. At least you could have bought the rice and
        lentils as I asked.” Thankamani calmly replied,
        <em>“God will help us.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Her faith proved true. Shortly afterwards, a neighbour named Prabhakaran
        Nair arrived, handing Mohanan 100 rupees. He explained, “I borrowed ten
        rupees for drink and needed to repay it, but I can’t touch your money.
        This is for you, from someone in Vellithode.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan marvelled at God’s provision through a stranger. That money
        sustained their family for the next ten days.
    </p>
    <h4>God’s Faithfulness</h4>
    <p>
        Reflecting on their journey, Mohanan often quoted the psalmist:
        <em>“I have been young, and now I am old; yet I have not seen the righteous
            forsaken, nor his descendants begging bread.”</em>
        (Psalm 37:25).
    </p>
    <p>
        God’s faithfulness had been evident throughout their lives. From the
        weekly visits of a selfless brother to the timely provision of a
        wheelchair, and even the unexpected gift of money, Mohanan’s family
        experienced the truth of the prayer,
        <em>“Give us this day our daily bread.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The God who provided manna in the wilderness had not forgotten Mohanan,
        nor would He ever forget him.
    </p>

    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="26" class="chapnum">26</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Safe In The Everlasting Arms</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">J</span>ayaprakash, the son of Mohanan and
        Thankamani, was a frail baby at birth and suffered frequent illnesses
        throughout his childhood. Shortly after the family moved to
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>, the boy developed a severe sinus infection, with pus draining
        continuously from his nose. Desperate for a cure, they consulted five
        different doctors, but his condition showed no improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Jayaprakash turned four, Mohanan began a routine of reading the Bible
        and praying with his son. Thankamani, however, refrained from joining
        them, and her brothers openly blamed Mohanan’s spiritual practices for the
        child’s persistent illnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, while reading the Gospels together, Mohanan and Jayaprakash came
        across the story of Jesus healing a lunatic. Moved by the account, Mohanan
        asked his son, “Do you believe the Lord Jesus can heal you?” With
        childlike faith, Jayaprakash answered, “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Placing his hand on the boy’s head, Mohanan prayed fervently. From the
        very next day, the pus stopped draining, and the infection never returned.
        It was a miracle that reaffirmed Mohanan’s faith and strengthened his bond
        with his son.
    </p>
    <h4>A Night of Surrender</h4>
    <p>
        Later, Jayaprakash fell gravely ill once more and had to be hospitalised.
        He remained in the hospital for weeks with his mother by his side,
        eventually undergoing surgery that restored his health. Upon returning
        home, however, the boy developed severe constipation and urinary
        retention, lasting 48 hours. He refused to eat, and his condition worsened
        to the point where everyone feared the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thankamani and her mother were inconsolable, weeping bitterly and unable
        to eat. Mohanan, overwhelmed by his inability to help his son, retreated
        to the yard. In his anguish, he poured out his heart to God, saying, “I am
        a father, yet I can do nothing to care for my family. Why has God placed
        such a burden on me?” In utter despair, he pleaded,
        <em>“Take my life, Lord. I can’t go on like this.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Opening his Bible, his eyes fell upon Psalm 35. The sacred words revealed
        his mistake—he’d been placing more weight on the family’s fears and advice
        than on trusting God. With a contrite heart, Mohanan confessed his lack of
        faith, saying,
        <em>“Father, you gave me this child; now I give him back into your
            hands.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        A deep peace washed over him. He went back inside, lay down, and fell into
        a restful sleep—a stark contrast to his earlier torment. That night,
        something miraculous happened. Jayaprakash began to vomit, and shortly
        thereafter, he passed both urine and stool. His recovery was complete, and
        Mohanan felt as though a plague had been lifted, just as described in the
        Bible.
    </p>
    <h4>Lessons in Solitude</h4>
    <p>
        While Thankamani and Jayaprakash were in the hospital, Mohanan was left
        alone at home for several days. With no modern conveniences and no one to
        rely on, he turned to God for even the smallest needs. One morning, he
        prayed for a bucket of water to brush his teeth and wash his clothes.
        Within minutes, his sister-in-law appeared. When he asked her for help,
        she brought him not one but three buckets of water.

            Palathinkadavu</a>
        was a relentless trial for Mohanan. Isolated in a sparsely furnished
        house, surrounded by hostile relatives and vast farms stretching across
        ten to fifteen acres, he was profoundly alone. Yet this period of hardship
        became a crucible for spiritual growth. It was here, in this solitude,
        that God moulded him into a true disciple, teaching him the depths of
        faith, trust, and surrender.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">God, Our Surety</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan Nair had witnessed countless miracles
        in his life. One such occasion occurred while the family was living at
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>. Thankamani had been out of work for a week, and their meagre resources
        were utterly depleted. In desperation, Mohanan remembered he’d lent a
        total of 225 rupees to three individuals some time ago. If only they would
        repay the loan!
    </p>
    <p>
        Frustrated and anxious, he poured out his heart to God: “Lord, I lent them
        the money because <em>You</em> commanded us to lend to those who ask.
        <em>You</em> are my surety—shouldn’t <em>You</em> repay me now?” Though
        his plea reflected spiritual immaturity, it was an honest cry from a
        desperate heart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Around one o’clock that afternoon, the postman arrived, having walked
        eight kilometres to reach their remote home. To Mohanan’s astonishment, he
        brought three money orders, totalling 250 rupees. As Mohanan signed for
        the money, his heart swelled with gratitude, and he began to praise God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, even as he offered thanks, Mohanan sensed a gentle but firm rebuke
        from the Lord: “What did you say to Me this morning? Didn’t you call
        <em>Me</em> your surety? Indeed, <em>I am your surety</em>. When I say
        ‘Yes,’ it is unchanging. You must believe My word.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Overcome with grief and shame, Mohanan wept. He realised that everything
        he possessed came from the Lord, including the money he’d lent. Yet, in
        his moment of need, he’d grumbled as though it were his own and forgotten
        the unwavering faithfulness of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Humbled, Mohanan asked for God’s forgiveness. The Lord, in His mercy,
        reassured him: “I have provided for you—not only the full repayment but
        also interest. Do not ask for the money back from those you lent to.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, within a few days, two of the three borrowers unexpectedly repaid
        their loans, each returning 100 rupees. Mohanan marvelled at God’s
        provision and was reminded once more of His abundant grace.
    </p>
    <h4>Living with Integrity</h4>
    <p>
        This experience deepened Mohanan’s conviction that God desires honesty and
        transparency in His people. As an old song reflects, “I wandered a million
        ages to find a man with a single face.” Do Christians wear one face, or
        many? God calls His children to live with integrity—to let their inner
        lives match their outward actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Long ago, God instructed that His altar should not be built with dressed
        stones, a vivid symbol of His disdain for hypocrisy. He desires hearts
        that are laid bare before Him, unpretentious and sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Bible, even great leaders wrestled with doubt and frustration.
        Moses, burdened by the weight of leading Israel, once cried out to God:
        “Did I conceive all these people? Did I beget them, that You should say to
        me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a guardian carries a nursing child, to
        the land which You swore to their fathers?’”
    </p>
    <p>
        God, in His compassion, listened to Moses and responded graciously: “Tell
        this people that I’ll provide food for them tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The psalmist captures this tender mercy beautifully in Psalm 103: “He
        knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust. He has not dealt with us
        according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. As for
        man, his days are like grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
        For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place remembers it no
        more. But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on
        those who fear Him, and His righteousness to children’s children.”
    </p>
    <p>
        God’s faithfulness is unchanging. Whether in times of abundance or
        scarcity, His mercy sustains His children, providing not only for their
        physical needs but also shaping their hearts for His glory.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Six Years In The Wilderness</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">A</span>t
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>, Mohanan devoted much of his time to fellowship with God through prayer
        and meditation on Scripture. Since Thankamani had not yet embraced faith
        in Christ, she joined him in prayer reluctantly and only at his firm
        insistence. Exhausted by her daily work, she’d often fall asleep as he
        prayed. Despite her hesitance, their six-year-old son, Jayaprakash, always
        participated eagerly, his youthful innocence a source of encouragement to
        his father.
    </p>
    <p>
        During their prayer sessions, Mohanan would ask Thankamani to read aloud
        from the New Testament, hoping this would help her understand God’s truth.
        But her faith, such as it was, remained hidden. Whenever one of her
        relatives appeared unexpectedly, she’d hurriedly shove the Bible under the
        mattress, fearing their disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their life together was far from harmonious. The differences in their
        outlook—his rooted in faith, hers shaped by the harsh realities of
        life—often led to disagreements. Thankamani’s struggles were immense. She
        had lost a healthy husband just a year into their marriage. With limited
        education and no financial security, she bore the weight of the family on
        her shoulders, managing the household, earning a living, and caring for
        her husband and young son.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan’s heart broke for her spiritual condition, and he prayed earnestly
        for her salvation, often enlisting the prayers of other believers. After
        every quarrel, he took the initiative to make peace, knowing that his
        faith called for reconciliation. If he lost his temper and she became
        distressed, he’d apologise and seek to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
        One memorable incident underscored his spiritual determination.
        Thankamani, against Mohanan’s wishes, took Jayaprakash to see a film.
        While they were away, Mohanan prayed fervently and tearfully for their
        safety until they returned home. From that day on, she never went to the
        cinema again.
    </p>
    <h4>Isolation and Faith</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan believed that fear held Thankamani back from openly confessing her
        faith. He felt they needed to move away from the influence of her family,
        not only for her spiritual growth but also for his own need to worship
        freely and fellowship with other believers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Occasionally, Pentecostal believers visited their home, which Mohanan
        welcomed. However, these visits sometimes resulted in overnight prayer
        vigils characterised by loud singing, shouting, and clapping. The noise
        disturbed the peace of the entire neighbourhood, leading to complaints and
        criticism the following day. Mohanan found these displays—tongues,
        supposed prophecy, and general commotion—distasteful, feeling they did
        more harm than good.
    </p>
    <p>
        Living in the remote, hilly terrain of
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>
        brought further challenges. Transportation was difficult, and meetings
        with fellow believers were rare. Occasionally, his friend Vijayamohan
        visited, offering brief moments of fellowship. News from the outside world
        was sparse, but after two and a half years, believers from the Kannur
        Brethren Assembly gifted Mohanan a radio. This small device became his
        lifeline, allowing him to listen to news, gospel messages, and educational
        programmes. True to his convictions, he never tuned in to light music,
        film songs, or radio dramas, choosing instead to honour God in every
        aspect of his life.
    </p>
    <h4>God’s Provision</h4>
    <p>
        As time passed, Mohanan prayed earnestly for a chance to move to a place
        where he could worship freely and be part of a supportive church
        community. One night, a visitor arrived at their home—a brother named A.
        K. Skariah, a government executive engineer from Kottayam. Skariah had
        heard about Mohanan from believers in Kannur and was eager to meet him.
        Despite his fatigue after the arduous climb to their home, the two men
        talked late into the night. Skariah even recorded their conversation to
        share with others in his church.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although Mohanan never mentioned his needs—financial or otherwise—Skariah
        discerned the challenges he faced. As a faithful disciple of Christ,
        Skariah shared Mohanan’s story with his congregation upon returning home,
        setting in motion God’s plan for Mohanan’s future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Four years earlier, Mohanan’s father had scornfully refused his request
        for five cents of land to build a house. From that day forward, Mohanan
        resolved to make his needs known only to his heavenly Father. Now, those
        prayers were about to be answered, as God prepared to fulfil His plans for
        Mohanan and his family.
    </p>

    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="29" class="chapnum">29</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Trusting God’s Timing</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>owards the end of Mohanan’s third year at
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>, a minor altercation broke out between one of Thankamani’s brothers—who
        had had a bit too much to drink—and their father. Tempers flared, and the
        heated argument soon turned physical. When Thankamani attempted to
        intervene, a stray blow struck her lip, causing it to swell painfully.
        Mohanan, already on edge, scolded her harshly, adding to her distress.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overhearing this, Thankamani’s mother unleashed a torrent of taunts at
        Mohanan. That night, he lay awake, deeply troubled. Six years had passed
        since he’d come to the Lord, yet he was still unable to practise his faith
        openly in his own home. He felt confined and ostracised, treated with
        contempt by those around him. Only later did he come to understand that
        God was using these struggles to mould and refine him, breaking his
        self-reliance and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
        In April 1992, Mohanan’s prayers took on renewed urgency. He begged his
        heavenly Father for five cents of land—a modest 202 square metres—where he
        could worship freely and find peace. This had long been his prayer, but
        now it felt more pressing than ever. Just days later, he received a letter
        from Brother Skariah.
    </p>
    <p>
        Skariah, recalling his visit to
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/75Egv2BYwLkRkqr7A" target="_blank">
            Palathinkadavu</a>, shared that he and a few others felt led by the Lord to help Mohanan
        relocate. They had pooled together enough money to purchase five cents of
        land and asked Mohanan to prayerfully decide where he’d like to settle,
        whether in Kottayam or elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h4>Seeking God’s Will</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan later recounted, “The idea of moving to Kottayam appealed to my
        rational mind. It seemed like a chance to escape the hostility of my
        family and in-laws, to finally live free from their disapproval. I naively
        believed that being surrounded by believers would spare me from poverty.
        But even as I prayed, I realised that I needed to seek God’s will, not my
        own.”
    </p>
    <p>
        In his prayers, he admitted his inability to choose wisely and asked God
        for guidance. He felt convicted of his desire for comfort and committed
        instead to following God’s direction, no matter the cost. In that moment,
        he sensed God’s call—to become His witness in a place with no other
        Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan was struck by the clarity of this revelation. Encouraged by the
        scripture, “By the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter shall be
        established,” he asked for three signs to confirm this calling.
    </p>
    <h4>God’s Confirmations</h4>
    <p>
        The first sign came that very night. In a vivid dream, Mohanan saw his old
        friend Vijayamohan calling out to him: “Look, these people are dying. Come
        and help me, brother.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day, Vijayamohan unexpectedly visited. Mohanan shared his prayers
        and desire to relocate, and Vijayamohan said, “About 60 kilometres from
        here, there’s a place where people are perishing without knowing God.
        There’s also a plot of land for sale, and much ministry is needed in the
        area.” This, to Mohanan, was the second confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third confirmation came through scripture. Inspired by the story of
        Abraham’s servant seeking a bride for Isaac, Mohanan prayed, “Lord, lead
        me to the place You have prepared for me, and I’ll look no further.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon after, Vijayamohan and Pastor Dennis arrived to take Mohanan to
        Kaithachal, near Koothuparamba. Before leaving, Mohanan prayed for a final
        sign: “Let the first plot we visit be the one You have chosen.”
    </p>
    <h4>God’s Generosity</h4>
    <p>
        At Kaithachal, they arrived at a plot of 11.5 cents (445 square metres)
        with a small house. As Mohanan sat in the front yard, he immediately knew
        this was the land God had prepared for him. To his amazement, the property
        had all the features suggested by the brothers in Kottayam and was more
        than twice the size he’d prayed for. Overjoyed, he decided to buy the
        land.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back home, a brother from Kottayam visited to finalise the purchase.
        Mohanan explained that the plot cost 4,000 rupees more than the amount
        they had raised. To his surprise, the brother replied, “We’ve brought the
        full 31,000 rupees.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan marvelled at God’s provision. He had prayed for five cents of
        land, but God had given him far more.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 9th June 1992, Mohanan moved into his new home at Kaithachal, a place
        he named “<i>Karunya Bhavan</i>” (Home of Compassion) in honour of God’s
        abundant mercy. The property was surrounded by all the conveniences they
        needed—electricity, water, schools, shops, transport, and more—but there
        were no other Christians in the area.
    </p>
    <h4>Trusting God Alone</h4>
    <p>
        Years earlier, when Mohanan’s father had refused his request for a small
        piece of land, his elder brother urged him to litigate for his share of
        the inheritance, even offering his own portion to support him. But
        Mohanan, having learned to trust God, declined. “I’ll never grieve my God
        by fighting my parents,” he told his brother. “Their property is theirs to
        give or withhold. I trust my Father in heaven to provide for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
        His brother dismissed him as foolish, but Mohanan stood firm, obeying
        God’s command to “Honour your father and mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Six years of waiting had taught him that God’s timing is perfect.
        Mohanan’s faith was rewarded with a home far beyond what he’d imagined.
        His story reminds us that those who trust in the Lord will not be put to
        shame. As the scripture says, “Casting all your cares upon Him, for He
        cares for you.”

    <h1 class="chaptitle">‘I, Too, Desire To Follow Christ!’</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">J</span>esus said:
        <em>“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his
            cross and follow me.”</em>
        (Matthew 16:24)
    </p>
    <p>
        Life at Kaithachal was far from easy. Mohanan, a newcomer to the village
        and its only Christian, faced numerous challenges. Yet, amidst the
        struggles, something remarkable happened just two weeks after his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nearly two years after his conversion, Mohanan had come to understand
        through his study of the scriptures that water baptism was essential. He
        believed it was God’s will for all who had repented of their sins and
        placed their faith in Jesus Christ. Despite his deep conviction, however,
        the opportunity had eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan had shared his desire for baptism with both Babychayan and
        Vijayamohan, but practical obstacles stood in the way. Given his physical
        condition, there was no nearby pool or pond suitable for the rite.
        Vijayamohan had reassured him, saying, “God will make it possible in His
        time.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, at Kaithachal, as Mohanan reflected on the biblical teaching about
        baptism with two friends, he sensed that the long-awaited time had finally
        come. He shared his decision with his friends and Thankamani, announcing
        that Pastor Dennis would baptise him in Kannur the very next day. For
        Mohanan, this was the moment to fully identify with his Lord in His death
        and burial through baptism.
    </p>
    <p>
        That night, as they prepared for the journey, Thankamani surprised him
        with an unexpected declaration.
        <em>“I have decided to be baptised with you,”</em>
        she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan, taken aback, asked her, “Why do <em>you</em> want to be
        baptised?”
    </p>
    <img src="./img/112-eng.webp" alt="" />
    <p>
        Her reply was heartfelt: “Is Jesus Christ just for you? <em>I, too, want to follow Him</em>! For three years, I
        have
        heard the Word of God and treasured it in my
        heart. I kept silent because I feared my brothers, but now God has brought
        us to a place where we can live and pray freely. I’ll no longer oppose
        your decision. I am ready to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my Saviour.”
    </p>
    <h4>A Shared Faith</h4>
    <p>
        The Bible teaches that a husband and wife are no longer two, but one
        flesh. From the start of his journey of faith, Mohanan had prayed
        fervently for his wife’s salvation, believing that one body could not walk
        in two separate faiths. Now, overwhelmed with tears of joy, he saw his
        prayer answered in a way that exceeded his hopes. That night was filled
        with songs and heartfelt prayers as they praised God together for His
        abundant grace.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day, Mohanan and Thankamani travelled to Kannur with Pastor
        Dennis. At the church gathered there, they testified of God’s faithfulness
        and guidance over the past six years. Supported by two brothers, Mohanan
        entered the baptism tank and was baptised, followed by Thankamani.
        Together, they publicly declared their faith and union with Christ.
    </p>
    <h4>The Meaning of Baptism</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan later reflected, “Christian baptism is <em>not</em> a mere
        ceremony or empty symbol. As Romans 6:1-7 teaches, it is a spiritual union
        with Christ. Through baptism,
        <em>we are joined to His death, burial, and resurrection.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Jesus Christ, though He was the Son of God, knew it was right in God’s
        sight to be baptised by John the Baptist before beginning His public
        ministry. When He came up out of the water, the Holy Spirit descended upon
        Him like a dove, and a voice from heaven declared, ‘This is my beloved
        Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him.’
    </p>
    <p>
        “If the sinless Son of God humbled Himself to obey this command, how much
        more do we, sinners, need to bury our old natures through baptism?”
    </p>
    <p>
        For Mohanan and Thankamani, their baptism marked not just an act of
        obedience but a profound moment of transformation—a step of faith that
        brought them closer to God and to each other. It was a new beginning,
        grounded in the promise of life in Christ.

        The local community harboured deep prejudices against Christianity,
        viewing the family with suspicion. Rumours circulated that they were using
        foreign funds to lure others into converting. The neighbours treated them
        with open hostility, as if they were outcasts or worse—rabid dogs.
    </p>

    <p>
        On their third Sunday in Kaithachal, Mohanan and Thankamani, along with a
        few believers led by Vijayamohan, gathered for prayer in a neighbour’s
        house. However, the meeting took a disturbing turn when a group of RSS
        workers surrounded the house. They hurled insults, destroyed Bibles, and
        tore up songbooks. The group of Christians, shaken but resolute, waited in
        silence for their attackers to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the commotion subsided, Vijayamohan turned to Mohanan and asked,
        “What do you think we should do now?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan responded with conviction: “The scriptures teach us to love our
        enemies and pray for them. Let us pray for our RSS brothers.”
    </p>

    <p>
        With hearts broken but steadfast, the group began to pray fervently for
        their persecutors. As they prayed, their spirits were renewed, and they
        found strength in their faith.
    </p>

    <h4>A Spirit-Led Message</h4>

    <p>
        After the prayers, Vijayamohan asked Mohanan to share a message from the
        Bible. Mohanan hesitated. He had never preached before and had no idea
        where to begin. With a silent prayer for God’s guidance, he asked the Holy
        Spirit to use him.
    </p>

    <p>
        Immediately, a verse came to his mind: “Yet if any man suffer as a
        Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf”
        (1 Peter 4:16).
    </p>

    <p>
        He began to preach on this theme, sharing additional scriptures that
        flowed effortlessly to him. He quoted: “Blessed are they which are
        persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
        Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say
        all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be
        exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they
        the prophets which were before you” (Matthew 5:10-12).
    </p>

    <p>
        The Spirit-led message encouraged the small gathering, strengthening their
        faith. They forgot the fear and pain of the earlier attack, rejoicing
        instead in the Word of God ministered to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        As they left the house, some of their assailants still loitered nearby.
        The Christians extended hands of friendship, but the men snarled at them.
        One spat a chilling warning at Vijayamohan: “Keep out of Kaithachal, or
        we’ll cut off your legs.”
    </p>

    <p>
        These threats were intended to frighten the believers into abandoning
        their faith. But Mohanan reflected later: “They don’t know that Christ’s
        disciples are like tempered steel, not fragile flowers that wither in the
        sun. Satan still does not understand this truth. We don’t struggle against
        flesh and blood—even if our bodies are killed, our spirits are secure in
        Christ. As Jesus said, ‘Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot
        kill the soul.’”
    </p>

    <h4>A Fellowship is Born</h4>

    <p>
        The following Sunday, Vijayamohan returned to Kaithachal with three
        believers from the Kannur church. They gathered at Mohanan’s modest home,
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, marking the start of regular meetings there.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the meeting, Vijayamohan laid his hands on Mohanan’s head,
        appointing him to lead the gathering. Mohanan gasped in disbelief.
        “Brother, I don’t even know how to lead!”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Take courage,” Vijayamohan replied. “The Holy Spirit will teach you
        everything in His time.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, a mob had gathered outside another house, planning to ambush
        the visitors from Kannur. Anticipating trouble, Pastor Dennis and the
        brothers avoided the obvious route and arrived by taxi instead. Despite
        this precaution, they were pursued up to Mohanan’s house.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the meeting, the mob attacked, beating the brothers as they left.
        Remarkably, Vijayamohan did not resist. Instead, he raised his hands in
        blessing, declaring God’s name over his attackers. His response echoed the
        words of Jesus:
    </p>

    <p class="quotation">
        <i>“Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that
            hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,
            that you may be children of your Father in heaven”</i>
        (Matthew 5:44-45).
    </p>

    <p>
        This unexpected act of love softened the hearts of many onlookers. A
        public outcry ensued, forcing the mob to relent. Though the brothers were
        insulted and their guitar stolen, they were allowed to leave unharmed.
    </p>

    <h4>God’s Sovereign Plan</h4>

    <p>
        In the aftermath, the Koothuparamba believers advised caution, suggesting
        a temporary retreat. Yet Mohanan and his family continued to meet weekly
        with another Christian couple for prayer and communion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reflecting on these events, Mohanan marvelled: “I, who longed for a church
        gathering to attend, found myself entrusted with a small fellowship!”
    </p>

    <p>
        He began to see God’s hand in every detail. Even his father’s refusal to
        grant him land years earlier now made sense—without that rejection, he
        would never have come to Kaithachal or this home, so perfectly placed for
        God’s work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan concluded: “God’s children must trust His promises implicitly.
        ‘All things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are
        called according to His purpose.’ We may falter, but He never does. His
        Word is unchanging, and His plans are beyond compare.”
    </p>

    <p id="32" class="chapnum">32</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">My First Cheque</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Mohanan and his family moved into
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>—the “House of Compassion”—the house lacked a toilet.
        For Mohanan, a paraplegic, this was a significant hardship.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thankamani, his wife, sold her share of the cashew crop from her family
        farm in Palathinkadavu, raising 5,000 rupees. While this was far from
        sufficient to build a toilet and cover their daily needs, they decided to
        press on. They began searching for someone who could undertake the work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being new to the area, Mohanan sought the help of a man named Vasu, who
        had shown some interest in the gospel. Vasu recommended a relative who, in
        turn, assembled a team of workers loyal to either the Hindu nationalist
        RSS or the Communist Party. Unfortunately, their intentions were far from
        noble. Mohanan overheard them conspiring: “He’s getting funds from foreign
        countries, so why should we keep the cost low? Let’s make it as hard as
        possible for him.”
    </p>

    <img src="./img/118-eng.webp" alt="" />

    <p>
        Before his accident, Mohanan had worked as a bricklayer and was
        well-versed in construction costs and timeframes. He quickly realised they
        were exploiting him. A job that should’ve taken two days—digging a
        five-foot foundation and a six-foot septic pit—was deliberately stretched
        to ten days. Despite knowing he was being cheated, Mohanan paid their
        wages without quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
        When his funds ran out, he adapted. He reduced the height of the toilet
        platform to a manageable one foot and, with the help of a neighbour, used
        golden cane palm trunks to support a tiled roof.
    </p>
    <h4>Compassion Amid Hardship</h4>
    <p>
        One day, while working on the toilet, an elderly woman approached him.
        Hobbling along, she explained that a chronic headache caused by a skull
        infection had left her in agony. Holding out her prescription, she begged
        for a little money to buy medicine. Though Mohanan was struggling
        financially, he couldn’t turn her away. He handed her fifty rupees.
    </p>
    <p>
        The woman was deeply touched by his kindness and later told her family
        about “Jesus Mohanan”—the nickname by which he was known locally. However,
        this simple act of generosity only fuelled rumours that he was
        distributing foreign funds to entice people to Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
        “How sad,” Mohanan reflected, “when acts of kindness are twisted into
        slander.” Yet, he found solace in God’s word: “Blessed are you when people
        revile you and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.”
    </p>
    <h4>Desperation and Divine Intervention</h4>
    <p>
        The family faced mounting challenges. Ostracised and insulted by their
        neighbours, they also endured sickness and scarcity. Their savings
        dwindled. Unlike their life in Palathinkadavu, where they had avoided
        debt, here they were friendless and destitute. Mohanan, as a paraplegic,
        was considered an unreliable credit risk. To make matters worse, sickness
        struck the entire household.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jayaprakash, their son, fell ill first, followed by Mohanan, whose
        recurring urinary infection flared up, leaving him shivering with fever.
        Finally, Thankamani, their pillar of strength, was bedridden. They had
        enough rice for only one more day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two seekers, who had previously expressed interest in Jesus, arrived
        unexpectedly with two kilograms of rice. Shocked by the family’s plight,
        they left disheartened. Later, a neighbour stopped by and remarked to
        Thankamani, “What sort of life is this? Your husband is crippled, your son
        is sick, and now you’re ill too. And you believe in Jesus Christ?”
    </p>
    <p>
        These words haunted Mohanan that night as he tried to pray. It felt as
        though Satan himself was taunting him: “I’ll drive you back to
        Palathinkadavu. I’ll crush you with trouble, sickness, and persecution.
        I’ll stop you from sharing the gospel.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sick and despairing, Mohanan groaned before the Lord. But as he poured out
        his heart, he felt God’s presence renewing his strength. “Satan is a
        liar,” he reminded himself, “and the father of lies.” He prayed earnestly
        for healing for his wife and son.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next morning, the family awoke much improved. Later that day, Mohanan
        received a cheque for 1,000 rupees. It had been sent by a trust in
        Thiruvananthapuram on behalf of an anonymous donor in Saudi Arabia.
    </p>
    <p>
        “This was the first cheque I’d ever received,” Mohanan recalled. “Even
        after fifteen years, I’ve not been able to thank the donor. It saved us
        from destitution. I saw God’s love at work. Hallelujah!”
    </p>
    <p>
        For the next three years, by God’s mercy, none of them fell ill. Living
        amidst hostility, far from friends and fellow believers, they gradually
        began to win people to Christ. Opposition lessened, and their fellowship
        grew to include about thirty believers.
    </p>
    <h4>A New Challenge</h4>
    <p>
        Just as the fellowship began to thrive, a new challenge arose—this time
        from within. False teachers infiltrated the church, leading many astray
        and scattering the believers. Tragically, twenty-two of the new converts
        abandoned their faith and returned to their old ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan was disheartened. But in the quiet of his soul, he heard the
        Lord’s assurance: “Every plant that my Father has not planted will be
        rooted up. Keep serving me.”
    </p>
    <p>
        His courage rekindled, Mohanan pressed on. He knew that following Christ
        was never easy. The narrow path is hard, and few choose it. Even during
        His earthly ministry, many of Jesus’ disciples abandoned Him. When Jesus
        asked the Twelve, “Do you also want to go?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter answered: “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal
        life.”
    </p>
    <p>
        This profound truth anchored Mohanan’s faith. Those who truly know Jesus
        Christ cannot leave Him, no matter the trials they face.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the Apostle Paul declared: “Who shall separate us from the love of
        Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
        nakedness, or peril, or sword? ... I am persuaded that neither death nor
        life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor
        powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be
        able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans
        8:35, 38-39).
    </p>

    <hr />
    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="33" class="chapnum">33</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Life Transformed: Faith in Action</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">D</span>uring this period, Mohanan met John
        Varghese, affectionately known as Rajan Sir, of the Evangel Press in
        Tiruvalla. Accompanied by Brother A. K. Skariah, Rajan Sir listened
        intently as Mohanan recounted the trials and triumphs of his first three
        years as a Christian.
    </p>

    <h4>Mohanan’s Story Comes To Light</h4>
    <p>
        This encounter inspired the publication of In the Furnace of Pain, a
        booklet that chronicled Mohanan’s journey of faith. The story touched
        countless lives. Many readers, struggling with their own weaknesses, were
        drawn closer to God. They were moved by the testimony of a young man who,
        once depressed and suicidal, had surrendered his life to the Creator.
        Through this surrender, Mohanan saw despair transformed into hope, sorrow
        into joy, turmoil into peace, and restlessness into rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience solidified Mohanan’s resolve to dedicate the rest of his
        life to God. Acknowledging his physical limitations, he willingly offered
        himself as an instrument for divine purposes, trusting that God could use
        even his helplessness to achieve great things.
    </p>
    <h4>Prayers Answered</h4>
    <p>
        At <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, the “House of Compassion,” Mohanan’s commitment
        bore fruit. Faithful, unceasing prayer led many to repentance and faith in
        Christ. Though Mohanan had not ventured outside his home for seven years,
        a growing sense of purpose stirred within him. He began praying for
        healing or, failing that, a three-wheeled cycle that would enable him to
        travel and minister more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not long after, Vijayamohan, his close companion, heard of a three-wheeler
        for sale in Kannur. Its owner, who was losing his eyesight, wished to sell
        it. Vijayamohan inspected the vehicle to ensure it was roadworthy and
        prayed over it, asking God to provide it for Mohanan. He shared this need
        with the church in Kannur during a prayer meeting. By the end of the
        gathering, 2,000 rupees had been collected—enough to purchase the
        tricycle.
    </p>
    <p>
        With his new mode of transport, Mohanan’s life changed dramatically. For
        the next seven years, he used the tricycle to travel up to 15 kilometres
        from his home. He shopped for his family and shared the gospel wherever he
        went. The man who had once been destitute, rejected by his family, and too
        helpless even to bathe properly for six months, now found himself equipped
        for ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, when Mohanan received a new wheelchair, he gave his old one to
        another person with a disability. Reflecting on this, he said, “How
        blessed it would be if everyone obeyed the Bible’s teaching: ‘Let him who
        has two shirts give one to him who has none.’ The Bible is not just to be
        preached or revered; it is to be practised. We must constantly hear God’s
        voice reminding us, ‘If you love me, keep my commandments.’”
    </p>
    <h4>A Warning Against Selfishness</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan recalls an incident involving a family with three wheelchairs, all
        kept for their daughter, who was severely disabled. After her death during
        a pilgrimage to the Vatican in search of healing, a visitor suggested
        donating one of the unused wheelchairs to a poor man in need. The father,
        however, refused, considering them sacred reminders of his daughter. The
        visitor wryly remarked, “Sir, you can’t keep anything but a corpse in a
        coffin.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Without anyone to use them, the wheelchairs rusted away. Tragically,
        several members of this so-called Christian family died by suicide within
        a few years. Mohanan reflects on how slow Christians often are to obey the
        Word of God, despite their zeal in preaching and studying it.
    </p>
    <p>
        He draws attention to the forty-plus commands of Jesus in the Sermon on
        the Mount, observing that many Christians are like the Pharisees who
        “strain at a gnat but swallow a camel.” They meticulously follow minor
        rules they deem important, yet dismiss God’s direct commandments when they
        conflict with their lifestyles.
    </p>
    <p>
        God’s Word is unambiguous: His people cannot serve both Him and money.
        Yet, Christians often attempt to do so, prioritising wealth above all
        else. Mohanan warns, “If money’s place is stripped away from many churches
        and para-church organisations, all that will remain is a corpse. The Bride
        of Christ must cry out to God for deliverance from this slavery.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan believes it is only by God’s grace that he has lived free of the
        love of money for more than two decades. He advocates for a life of
        generosity, urging believers to relinquish selfishness—the sin that blocks
        the expression of God’s glory and dishonours His name.
    </p>
    <h4>Living Generously</h4>
    <p>
        Mohanan laments how some people, after recovering from illness or injury,
        hoard wheelchairs or medical equipment, either hoping to profit from them
        or fearing they might need them again. “Do they expect paralysis or injury
        to befall them or their loved ones in the future?” he asks incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
        He emphasises that believers must repent of such selfishness and instead
        embrace a life of trust in God. Jesus Himself taught that we need not
        store away treasures for tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan concludes, “Let us stretch out our hands in generosity and love,
        like the hands of our Lord. This is the way to honour His name and reflect
        His glory to the world.”
    </p>

    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="34" class="chapnum">34</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Overcoming Evil With Good</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">G</span>od sustained Mohanan’s family through
        countless challenges and adversities during their early years at
        Kaithachal. Shortly after their arrival, Mohanan decided to grow food to
        support the family. He sought permission from the owners of a neighbouring
        plot, which had remained uncultivated for years, to use the land for
        farming. With their consent, Mohanan’s family planted 200 tapioca
        cuttings, investing 200 rupees into the endeavour.
    </p>

    <p>
        The crop flourished, promising a generous harvest. However, a group of
        local youths, apparently amused by the thought of destroying the
        ‘Christian’ crop, began to vandalise it. Night after night, they uprooted
        or hacked down two or three plants, destroying a total of 17.
        Disheartened, Mohanan turned to God for guidance on how to respond to the
        injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer he received was clear: “Love your enemies, pray for those who
        persecute you.” Mohanan chose not to dwell on the losses but instead began
        praying for the vandals. He also felt prompted by the Holy Spirit to
        return good for evil, following the biblical instruction: “Do not be
        overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good” (Romans 12:21).
    </p>
    <p>
        In an extraordinary act of grace, Mohanan harvested two magnificent
        clusters of tapioca tubers and sent them to the families of the
        perpetrators. The following year, the vandalism was repeated, though on a
        smaller scale, with seven plants destroyed. Once again, Mohanan responded
        by sending gifts of tapioca to the families involved. By the third year,
        the crop remained untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan’s faith in action demonstrated that obedience to God’s Word has
        transformative power. Evil is overcome when it is met with good, and this
        principle applies to all human conflicts—whether political, religious, or
        communal. Disobedience to God is at the root of these problems, yet He
        holds the solution to them all.
    </p>
    <h4>Trusting God for Justice</h4>
    <p>
        The Bible teaches, “Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room
        for God’s wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’
        says the Lord” (Romans 12:19). Mohanan often reflected on this promise,
        finding solace in the knowledge that God is neither powerless nor
        indifferent. He is described in Scripture as a consuming fire, fully
        capable of defending His people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan recalls an incident involving a member of the Koothuparamba
        fellowship who was attacked by an anti-Christian mob. The believers
        responded with prayer, asking for God’s mercy on their assailants. Fifteen
        months later, the mob’s leader met a violent end, his headless body
        discovered after he was brutally killed by his own enemies. This shocking
        event marked the end of persecution in the area.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite such hostility, Mohanan and the fellowship chose not to retaliate.
        Instead, they prayed for their aggressors and treated them with kindness,
        as instructed by Christ. Over time, these acts of love softened even the
        hardest hearts. Those who had once slandered and opposed Mohanan’s family
        became their friends.
    </p>
    <h4>Wrestling with the True Enemy</h4>
    <p>
        Seven years ago, Mohanan gained a deeper understanding of the spiritual
        nature of conflict. As Ephesians 6:12 declares, “For we wrestle not
        against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
        against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
        wickedness in high places.” This revelation changed his perspective on
        enmity and opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mohanan committed to keeping enmity out of his heart, regardless of
        provocation. He often reminds himself, “These are flesh-and-blood people;
        my struggle is not with them. I must not fight a spiritual battle using
        earthly weapons.” He strives to follow the example of Christ, as outlined
        in 1 John 2:6: “Whoever claims to live in Him must live as Jesus did.”
    </p>
    <p>
        For the disciples of Christ, worldly wisdom and quarrels have no place.
        Instead, they are called to maintain God’s perspective, recognising that
        every problem has a spiritual root. Mohanan’s life is a testament to the
        power of unwavering faith, forgiveness, and love in the face of
        opposition.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Fan Sent From Heaven</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he family at <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> was too
        poor to afford a fan when they first settled there. During the sweltering
        summer months, the small, low, tin-roofed house became unbearably hot by
        mid-morning. Mohanan, unable to move freely due to his paraplegia, would
        lie soaked in sweat, tossing and turning in bed in search of a cooler
        spot. During the hottest hours, he’d sit outside briefly, but his fear of
        developing bedsores kept him from staying long, denying him the relief of
        shade under the nearby trees. Even at night, the oppressive heat and
        humidity offered little respite.
    </p>

    <p>
        Desperate for relief, Mohanan prayed fervently for a fan. A few days
        later, he and his wife, Thankamani, travelled to Kannur for three days of
        fasting and prayer, interceding for a woman who was mentally ill. On their
        return, Mohanan was astonished to find a brand-new Polar ceiling fan
        installed in his room. He learned that two young men had come the day
        before, borrowed the key from a neighbour, and fitted the fan before
        leaving.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overwhelmed with joy and gratitude, Mohanan praised the Lord for hearing
        his prayer. God had not simply provided the funds to purchase a fan, which
        would then have required additional effort to install. Instead, He had
        tenderly met Mohanan’s need in full, delivering a ready-to-use fan as an
        answer to his childlike faith.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Bible promises: “Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly
        above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in
        us…” (Ephesians 3:20). Mohanan took comfort in the apostle Paul’s
        exhortation to believers: “Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say,
        Rejoice… Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
        supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
        And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your
        hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:4-7).
    </p>

    <h4>Faith, Obedience, and God’s Blessings</h4>

    <p>
        Christians must not view God as a mere provider of material comforts while
        disregarding His commands. Instead, they should seek to grow spiritually,
        understanding His will for their lives. The Scriptures caution: “Behold,
        the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear
        heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated between you
        and your God…” (Isaiah 59:1-2). God’s Word reminds us to “Seek first the
        kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added
        to you” (Matthew 6:33).
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, many organisations and churches today emphasise God’s
        blessings while soliciting funds, disobeying His Word and doubting His
        power. This leads critics to mock Christians, accusing them of professing
        faith while relying on their own resources.
    </p>

    <p>
        As Ephesians 1:3 declares: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
        Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
        places in Christ.” Every spiritual blessing is found in Christ. John 1:16
        affirms: “And of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.”
    </p>

    <h4>God’s Timing and Provision</h4>

    <p>
        Mohanan’s family often faced extreme poverty, sometimes lacking even the
        meagre sum needed to purchase basic staples like rice or kerosene from the
        ration shop. On one such occasion, Mohanan had just 25 rupees, of which he
        first used one rupee to settle a small debt at a nearby teashop. Arriving
        at the ration shop, he found a long queue ahead of him. Normally, the
        shopkeeper would serve Mohanan first out of respect for his condition, but
        this time he’d to wait.
    </p>

    <p>
        As Mohanan waited, a local RSS leader approached him, saying, “I hear
        you’ve been facing some trouble.” Mohanan, the target of recent slanders
        due to his visit to a mentally ill individual, calmly replied, “Yes, but
        we must endure such trials for Jesus’ sake.” To his amazement, the man’s
        eyes filled with tears. Pressing a 100-rupee note into Mohanan’s hand, he
        left quickly. Mohanan immediately realised that this unexpected gift would
        cover all his needs and more. His patience had borne fruit, reinforcing
        the truth of Romans 8:28: “And we know that all things work together for
        good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His
        purpose.”
    </p>

    <h4>Acts of Fellowship and Blessing</h4>

    <p>
        Over the years, many of God’s servants visited <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>. On
        one occasion, P. G. Vargis, the founder of the Indian Evangelical Team,
        attended a meeting where Mohanan shared his testimony. After the meeting,
        Vargis and another evangelist, M. I. Eapen, accompanied Mohanan back to
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the journey, Mohanan became carsick. Vargis graciously held
        Mohanan’s young son, Jayaprakash, on his lap while comforting Mohanan. On
        arriving at the house, Vargis noticed a large pile of bricks intended for
        a dormitory construction project that had stalled due to lack of funds.
        Praying over the bricks, he asked God to provide for the project. Within a
        week, a donation of 10,000 rupees arrived, enabling the work to continue.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the building was completed, Mohanan invited Vargis for the
        dedication. Seeing the hall filled with 40 people, Vargis was so overjoyed
        that he began dancing. He preached from Psalm 23, testifying to God’s
        faithfulness.
    </p>

    <img src="./img/135-eng.webp" alt="" />

    <p>
        At another meeting in Koothuparamba, Mohanan hosted a meal for Vargis at
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>. Knowing Vargis’s love for traditional Kerala food,
        Mohanan asked Thankamani to prepare tapioca, chicken curry, and rice. That
        evening, Vargis remarked with delight, “I haven’t had tapioca in so long,
        but today I enjoyed my fill at Brother Mohanan’s house!”

    <p id="36" class="chapnum">36</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Priceless Value Of Honesty</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">I</span>ndia’s watchword is Satyameva Jayate—“Truth
        always triumphs.” Yet, corruption knows no borders. Nine years after
        Mohanan surrendered his life to Christ, he was confronted with the price
        of living out that truth in a world marred by dishonesty.
    </p>

    <p>
        After moving into <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, Mohanan applied for a domestic
        electricity connection. His disability status entitled him to a priority
        connection, but time and again, he was overlooked. The reason was simple:
        he refused to offer a bribe. For years, he waited patiently, holding to
        his convictions. Finally, one day, progress seemed within reach. An
        electricity pole was erected near his home, and cables were laid. Only the
        final connection remained, postponed to the following day due to time
        constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, Mohanan had mistakenly believed that once his house was
        electrified, he’d lose his entitlement to rationed kerosene. Determined to
        secure his monthly allocation, he hurried to the ration shop. To his
        dismay, there was no kerosene in stock. The shopkeeper assured him that
        fresh supplies would arrive by evening. Anxious about losing his quota,
        Mohanan requested the shopkeeper to mark the sale on his ration card that
        very day.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was three days before the kerosene finally arrived—two days after his
        electricity connection had been completed. When Mohanan returned to the
        ration shop to collect his share, the shopkeeper casually asked, “Did they
        finish connecting your electricity?”
    </p>

    <p>
        In that moment, fear gripped Mohanan. Afraid of losing the kerosene, he
        blurted out a denial. “No, not yet,” he said. But as the words left his
        lips, his conscience struck him like a hammer. He felt as though God’s
        voice was piercing through his soul, convicting him of his falsehood. For
        the sake of three litres of kerosene, he’d compromised the very “belt of
        truth” that forms a vital part of the believer’s spiritual armour.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was as if God was asking him, “Could you not trust me for so small a
        thing?” Mohanan realised that it is often small temptations, not grand
        crises, that lead to spiritual failure. When believers loosen their grip
        on truth in the little things, they become unfit for God to entrust them
        with greater responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overwhelmed by guilt, Mohanan hurriedly left the shop, clutching the
        kerosene as though it were a deadly substance—more lethal, in his mind,
        than cyanide. He even considered discarding it altogether. Instead of
        going home, he drove to a quiet, secluded spot. There, alone with God, he
        wept bitterly and pleaded for forgiveness.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan reflected on the years he’d experienced God’s sustaining grace,
        yet he’d doubted God’s ability to provide in this moment. His sense of
        failure was deeply personal, for he knew that his identity in Christ had
        transformed him. Before he came to the Lord, he might have dismissed such
        a lie as inconsequential. Now, however, his heart was tender to even the
        smallest deviation from God’s standard.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Bible says: “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
        are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17).
        For Mohanan, this verse was a living reality.
    </p>

    <h4>A Call to Conviction</h4>

    <p>
        Mohanan’s experience serves as a reminder to every believer. Those who
        claim to follow Christ but feel no conviction over sin must examine their
        hearts. Jesus said: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone
        hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and
        he with me” (Revelation 3:20).
    </p>

    <p>
        Let God’s people take this promise to heart, knowing that He is faithful
        to forgive and restore. Truth is not merely an ideal; it is a way of life
        for those who walk with Christ. Small as the cost may seem, it is always
        worth paying.
    </p>

    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="37" class="chapnum">37</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Shepherd’s Heart</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">I</span>n His marvellous plan, God used Mohanan’s
        great suffering to lead many others to Him. Among those touched by his
        life was Dineshkumar, who became part of the
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> fellowship.
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally from Wayanad, a neighbouring district, Dinesh had first met
        Mohanan nine years earlier through a mutual friend, Kamalakshy, a
        paraplegic woman. Not long after Mohanan settled at Kaithachal, Dinesh
        came to visit him. Despite threats from local extremists, Dinesh began
        attending every meeting. He faced persecution with remarkable courage:
        once, he was beaten at his workplace; another time, he was forcibly
        dragged to a temple and thrown prostrate before an idol. Even his own
        cousin was among his tormentors. Yet through it all, Dinesh held fast to
        Christ.
    </p>

    <p>
        As Dinesh approached the age of 27, Mohanan began to consider his marriage
        prospects. There was a devout young woman in their fellowship who attended
        with her father, though the rest of her family were not yet believers.
        When the idea of marriage was proposed, both families agreed. However,
        neither side was willing to organise the wedding, leaving the
        responsibility to Mohanan.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dinesh, a furniture polisher by trade, had saved 1000 rupees, which he
        handed to Mohanan to help cover the wedding costs. Mohanan added 5,000
        rupees, all that remained from the 35,000 rupees he’d received from
        selling Thankamani’s inherited land at Palathinkadavu. The majority of the
        money had gone toward paying off debts, while 3,000 rupees had been used
        to print 10,000 evangelistic tracts.
    </p>

    <p>
        The wedding strained Mohanan’s limited resources. He chose not to take his
        ten-year-old son, Jayaprakash, with him when shopping for the bride and
        groom’s wedding clothes. He feared his son might innocently ask for
        something new for himself, creating an awkward moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        As Mohanan sat in the clothes shop, waiting for the couple to return from
        buying shoes, his thoughts turned to the upcoming school year. Around him,
        parents were purchasing school supplies for their children. He was tempted
        to grumble at the situation. Why should he bear the expense of someone
        else’s wedding when he couldn’t afford to buy his own son a new satchel or
        umbrella? Poor Jayaprakash was eagerly anticipating the start of school
        the following week.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recognising the devil’s ploy, Mohanan turned to prayer. Silently, he
        poured out his heart to God, setting aside his worries to focus on the
        task at hand. That same evening, at around 8 o’clock, a visitor came to
        his house with a note. It read:
    </p>

    <p class="indented">
        “Dear Brother Mohanan Nair, which class is your son studying in? How much
        will his schooling cost this year? A friend of mine would like to sponsor
        his education. With love, Brother Joseph, Koothuparamba.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Overcome with gratitude, Mohanan responded: “Dear brother, this year my
        son Jayaprakash will be in the fifth grade. Please do as God directs you.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The following day, the young man returned with an envelope containing
        1,000 rupees. Mohanan was deeply moved by this timely provision. It was a
        reminder of God’s faithfulness, lifting his burden and reaffirming that
        God saw and cared for his needs.
    </p>

    <h4>A Call to Faithful Shepherding</h4>

    <p>Reflecting on this experience, Mohanan shared a profound message:</p>

    <p>
        “Do we truly care for the flock entrusted to us by God? Are we willing to
        sacrifice for their well-being, or do we view them as a source of personal
        gain? God watches how we shepherd His people.”
    </p>

    <p>
        For 37 years, Mohanan has served faithfully at
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> without seeking financial gain. In the early years,
        he passed the offering bag, but even then, he gave more to the fellowship
        than he received.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Many pastors and teachers today are driven by selfish greed. They exploit
        the very people they are called to serve. Yet Jesus taught, ‘It is more
        blessed to give than to receive.’ Ambassadors of Christ should trust that
        the One who called them will provide for them.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The Bible warns against self-serving leaders. As Ezekiel 34:2-4 (NLT)
        says:
    </p>

    <p class="quotation">
        “Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord: What sorrow awaits you
        shepherds who feed yourselves instead of your flocks. Shouldn’t shepherds
        feed their sheep? You drink the milk, wear the wool, and butcher the best
        animals, but you let your flocks starve. You have not taken care of the
        weak. You have not tended the sick or bound up the injured. You have not
        gone looking for those who have wandered away and are lost. Instead, you
        have ruled them with harshness and cruelty.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Such neglect and exploitation cause God’s sheep to wander and fall prey to
        destruction. The Lord’s judgement on these leaders is clear:
    </p>

    <p class="quotation">
        “I now consider these shepherds my enemies, and I will hold them
        responsible for what has happened to my flock. I will take away their
        right to feed the flock, and I will stop them from feeding themselves. I
        will rescue my flock from their mouths; the sheep will no longer be their
        prey.” (Ezekiel 34:10, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan’s life is a powerful testimony of what it means to shepherd with a
        servant’s heart, trusting God to meet every need. He calls on all leaders
        to heed Peter’s exhortation:
    </p>

    <p class="quotation">
        “Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you. Watch over it
        willingly, not grudgingly—not for what you will get out of it, but because
        you are eager to serve God. Don’t lord it over the people assigned to your
        care, but lead them by your own good example. And when the Great Shepherd
        appears, you will receive a crown of never-ending glory and honour.” (1
        Peter 5:2-4, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        May every shepherd embrace this calling, trusting the Lord to provide and
        lead. Only then can we stand with confidence before Him on that great Day.
    </p>

    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="38" class="chapnum">38</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Beauty Fades, Charm Misleads</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan remembers a young woman named
        Praseena, who was part of his prayer fellowship. For several years, she
        had suffered under the oppressive grip of demonic bondage, but through
        fervent prayer, she experienced complete deliverance. From then on, she
        grew into a devout and faithful Christian. She was the youngest of nine
        siblings—four brothers and four sisters—all but one older than her.
    </p>

    <p>
        Concerned about her future, Mohanan began to pray and seek God’s guidance.
        At 24, Praseena received a proposal of marriage from a man in Kozhikode.
        Her petite and delicate frame caused Mohanan to voice his apprehensions
        about her ability to handle the physical and emotional demands of married
        life. However, James Mathew of Nellipoyil, the young suitor, dismissed
        these fears with respect for her spiritual strength.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan eventually acknowledged that her outward appearance was
        insignificant compared to her inner character. He remained sceptical,
        though, about whether James would find her physically appealing. Yet,
        after their first meeting, James confided that he’d never met a woman who
        impressed him so deeply. Their engagement was set for the first of May.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, Praseena’s family refused to support the match. They
        objected because James was a Christian, and they believed it improper for
        her to marry before her elder sisters were wed. As a result, Mohanan, as
        the elder of her church, took it upon himself to organise the wedding.
    </p>

    <p>
        James had no expectation of a dowry—a practice Mohanan vehemently opposes
        as unscriptural. In the Old Testament, it was the bridegroom who gave a
        bride price to the bride’s family. Yet today, even among Pentecostal
        Christians in Kerala, the practice of demanding dowries persists. To
        Mohanan, this is a grave hypocrisy, a trap set by Satan to divert
        believers from God’s word, which warns, “For the love of money is the root
        of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from
        the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.” (1 Timothy 6:10,
        NLT)
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan often reflected on the double standards of those who insisted on
        dowries for their sons’ marriages. How would they feel, he wondered, if
        their own daughters were valued solely by their in-laws for their
        financial contributions? Is it, he asked, a sin to have a daughter?
    </p>

    <p>
        Even historical and cultural critiques echoed his thoughts. The French
        philosopher Voltaire remarked, “I have seen many Christians close up.
        Despite their differences in organisation and doctrine, they seem united
        in their love for money.” Similarly, the Kerala poet Kunchan Nambiar
        lamented, “We don’t care about anything as long as we get money.” Mohanan
        pondered why church leaders remained silent on this issue. Were they also
        ensnared by this greed?
    </p>

    <p>
        As for his own son, Jayaprakash, Mohanan vowed that a dowry would never be
        a factor in choosing his future bride. He believed that basing marriage on
        material considerations revealed a lack of spiritual maturity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Returning to Praseena’s wedding, Mohanan calculated that the event would
        cost around 10,000 rupees. At the time, he barely had ten rupees to his
        name. Undeterred, he prayed for provision. A believer from a charismatic
        church contributed 500 rupees for the wedding saree, while another donated
        1,000 rupees for other expenses. A few days later, a car pulled up to
        Mohanan’s home, and a man handed him a package containing exactly 10,000
        rupees. Mohanan was overwhelmed with gratitude for God’s miraculous
        provision.
    </p>

    <p>
        The wedding was a joyous occasion, and 23 years later, James and Praseena
        remain happily married with two children. Over the following six years,
        five of her siblings also married.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan lamented the decline in faith and values within the church. Many
        believers prioritised worldly attributes like physical beauty, social
        standing, intelligence, and wealth when seeking a spouse—qualities of
        little value in God’s eyes. Praseena’s story stood as a testament that God
        values trust and obedience far above outward appearances. As Scripture
        says, “Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears
        the Lord will be greatly praised.” (Proverbs 31:30, NLT)
    </p>

    <p>
        Some young women, fearing that their poverty or lack of status would
        hinder their prospects, grew bitter and resentful. Mohanan reminded them
        that even the wealthiest and most educated believers often faced the same
        struggles. He encouraged them to trust God to provide the right partner at
        the right time. As the story of Isaac and Rebekah demonstrated, God’s
        provision comes through his timing and purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan frequently highlighted Rebekah’s example of diligence and
        humility. When Abraham’s servant asked for a drink of water, Rebekah not
        only offered it willingly but also drew water for his ten camels—an act of
        extraordinary kindness and effort. Mohanan believed that when believers
        live with such a spirit of service and humility, God will direct his
        blessings to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        He cautioned young believers against compromising with sin in their
        pursuit of marriage. Quoting Scripture, he reminded them, “I will live in
        them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
        Therefore, come out from among unbelievers, and separate yourselves from
        them, says the Lord. Don’t touch their filthy things, and I will welcome
        you.” (2 Corinthians 6:16-17, NLT)
    </p>

    <p>
        Believers, he said, must keep their lives holy, trusting that God, who
        knows their hearts, will provide the best for them. They need not resort
        to worldly tactics to attract a partner. God’s word is clear: “You must be
        holy because I am holy.” (1 Peter 1:16, NLT)
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, Mohanan exhorted younger believers with the promise of Scripture:
        “Because we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves
        from everything that can defile our body or spirit. And let us work toward
        complete holiness because we fear God.” (2 Corinthians 7:1, NLT)
    </p>

    <p>
        God’s wisdom and provision remain steadfast. May his word strengthen and
        encourage his people, especially young women seeking his guidance in their
        lives.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Short Fuse: A Sinful Trait</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">A</span> biography must be honest to be credible,
        and Mohanan’s life was no exception. He was not a saint, and he openly
        acknowledged his flaws. During the ninth year of his walk with the Lord,
        Mohanan had a conversation with George, a friend from a charismatic
        church, while waiting for the inauguration of a new church hall. George
        had contributed to its construction, and as they chatted, he suggested
        they spend a few minutes in prayer.
    </p>

    <p>
        After praying, George gently brought up a sensitive topic: Mohanan’s
        temper. George had observed that Mohanan was quick to anger, especially
        with his family. He reminded him of Moses, whose anger had prevented him
        from entering the Promised Land, and stressed the importance of
        controlling one’s temper. It was the first time anyone had confronted
        Mohanan so directly, and though he tried to downplay it, George’s words
        stayed with him.
    </p>

    <p>
        That evening, during his prayers, Mohanan asked God if he truly was a
        short-tempered man. The answer came clearly and left him broken. Over the
        past nine years, he’d lost his temper at least 900 times—on average, once
        every three or four days. Deeply convicted, he confessed his sin with
        tears and sought forgiveness. He found solace in the example of Jesus, who
        “offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who
        could rescue him from death. And God heard his prayers because of his deep
        reverence for God” (Hebrews 5:7, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Until then, Mohanan had justified his anger by quoting, “And ‘don’t sin by
        letting anger control you.’ Don’t let the sun go down while you are still
        angry” (Ephesians 4:26, NLT). That night, however, he read the passage
        anew, allowing its deeper message to sink in: “Get rid of all bitterness,
        rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil
        behaviour. Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one
        another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you” (Ephesians 4:31–32,
        NLT). He realised that anger, in its essence, was a sin against God’s
        will.
    </p>

    <p>
        This revelation didn’t mark the end of Mohanan’s struggle with anger, but
        it did provide clarity. Before coming to Christ, anger had been a constant
        in his life. Since his conversion, the frequency had reduced, but
        occasional outbursts still occurred. Now, he sought to confess and combat
        each instance, striving to embody the patience and long-suffering of
        Christ.
    </p>

    <p>
        A few days later, he faced a practical test of his resolve. During lunch,
        served as always by his wife, Thankamani, he encountered tiny stones in
        the rice. Normally, this would’ve led to a heated outburst, but that day,
        God reminded him of the gratitude he’d expressed in his prayer over the
        meal. “You’ve already thanked me for this food,” God seemed to say. “So
        just pick out the stones and eat.” Mohanan obediently did so, removing
        eight tiny stones over the course of 45 minutes. Instead of frustration,
        he felt a profound peace. It was the best meal he’d ever had, not because
        of its taste but because of the victory over his temper.
    </p>

    <p>
        This incident transformed his perspective. He realised that cooks,
        including Thankamani, never spoil food intentionally. Seeing life through
        God’s eyes, he began responding with understanding and grace, rather than
        anger.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Bible is clear: “Human anger does not produce the righteousness God
        desires” (James 1:20, NLT). While some justify their temper by citing
        Jesus’ righteous anger when he cleared the temple, they often overlook the
        context. Jesus’ anger was directed at the desecration of God’s house, not
        personal affronts. Mohanan recognised that his own anger was rarely
        righteous—it stemmed from wounded pride, unmet expectations, or petty
        frustrations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Impatience was another of Mohanan’s struggles. It created tension at home,
        even contributing to Thankamani developing ulcers from stress. However, as
        he began to address his temper, the atmosphere in their home improved, and
        Thankamani’s health followed suit.
    </p>

    <p>
        God’s wrath, Mohanan reflected, is entirely different from human anger. It
        is holy and righteous, arising from his perfect nature and the disruption
        of his creation. In contrast, human anger is often selfish, destructive,
        and sinful.
    </p>

    <p>
        Christians, Mohanan believed, must actively wage war against anger. The
        apostle Paul reminded believers: “Don’t let sin control the way you live;
        do not give in to sinful desires” (Romans 6:12, NLT). Mohanan was
        encouraged by the assurance that, through Christ, victory over sin is
        possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        He often likened this spiritual battle to the conquest of Mount Everest.
        For years, climbers attempted the summit and failed, leaving many lives
        lost on the mountain’s slopes. But their perseverance eventually led to
        success, and now countless individuals have reached the peak. Similarly,
        believers, through steadfast faith and reliance on God, can overcome even
        their greatest weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan concluded with this encouragement: “God’s children can defeat the
        giant of anger, just as David defeated Goliath. When we stop justifying
        our sin and begin to obey God’s word, the Spirit produces patience,
        humility, and self-control within us. Let us strive to become more like
        Christ, ‘forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead’”
        (Philippians 3:13, NLT).

    <p id="40" class="chapnum">40</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Rock-Solid Foundation</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan reflects on a transformative moment
        in his life, ten years after coming to faith in Christ. By God’s grace, he
        had read the entire Bible ten times, the New Testament thirteen times, and
        the Psalms so frequently that he’d lost count. In those early years, he
        dedicated himself to reading and studying the Scriptures, gaining an
        understanding of the overarching message in nearly every book of the
        Bible.
    </p>

    <p>
        His mentor, Babychayan, a Sabbatarian, had faithfully taught him the Ten
        Commandments and the Law for two and a half years. However, as Mohanan
        delved deeper into Scripture, he encountered passages that seemed to
        challenge the necessity of Sabbath observance for Christians today.
        Despite his questions, Babychayan’s explanations remained unclear. Thus
        began Mohanan’s journey of seeking answers directly from God, studying the
        Bible with childlike humility.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the next seven years, God provided guidance through various books and
        teachers, though Mohanan realised that even the most insightful human
        writings fell short of fully capturing God’s truth. Some books aligned
        with Scripture ten percent, others fifty percent, but none completely.
        Reading without bias, he retained what was biblical and set aside the
        rest. This was not done in a spirit of criticism but with an understanding
        of human limitations—our perspectives are inevitably shaped by personal
        experiences and intellectual constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through his study, Mohanan grasped the divine plan of salvation and came
        to know Jesus Christ personally. Yet, one haunting question remained: why
        couldn’t he live in conformity with God’s Word? Though he’d learned
        obedience in many areas and experienced deliverance from numerous sins, he
        found himself grieved and guilt-ridden when reading Scripture and praying.
        The Bible’s call to overcome sin, grow in the Lord, and partake in His
        divine nature seemed beyond his reach. He often bowed his head in shame,
        confessing his inability to live as God commanded.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan observed that this struggle was not unique to him. Many believers
        appeared to live in spiritual defeat. Their prayers, worship, fasting, and
        ministry often masked their inability to lead holy lives. Few admitted it
        openly, but the struggle to live like Christ was evident.
    </p>

    <p>
        In his desperation, Mohanan prayed fervently for divine help to live
        according to God’s Word. One day, he received a modest-looking magazine
        titled “Hidden Treasure.” Despite its unremarkable appearance, the content
        resonated deeply with him. As he read, he felt an unexplainable sense of
        freedom. The truths within the magazine were exactly what he’d been
        seeking for the past decade. He read it three times, rejoicing in his
        spirit. The author, Zac Poonen, became an unexpected source of profound
        spiritual insights.
    </p>

    <p>
        A brother from Kozhikode had sent the magazine, though Mohanan had no idea
        how this person knew him or his address. Writing back, he requested more
        works by the same author. Months later, he received a book titled The
        Unshakable Foundation. Its very first chapter stopped him in his tracks.
        The author posed a thought-provoking question: “Imagine you are
        constructing a skyscraper, and cracks appear on the third or fourth floor.
        What is the only sensible course of action?” This question struck Mohanan
        personally, and he admitted to the Lord, “I’ve been building this mansion
        for ten years, but it’s showing huge cracks.”
    </p>

    <p>
        As he read further, the answer became clear. Cracks in a building signify
        a faulty foundation. The only solution is to demolish the structure and
        rebuild on a solid base, regardless of the cost or time required. This
        revelation exposed the root of Mohanan’s spiritual struggles: his life was
        not firmly grounded on the unshakable foundation of Jesus Christ. He had
        not dug deep enough to establish a lasting foundation, leading to
        inevitable cracks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reflecting on this truth, Mohanan recognised that many believers, even
        those in prominent church positions, face similar struggles. Their lives
        often fail to reflect the teachings of Christ, yet they fear admitting it
        due to the potential loss of respect and position. When God revealed the
        truth to Mohanan, he immediately repented. With the apostle Paul, he
        lamented, “Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this
        life that is dominated by sin and death? Thank God! The answer is in Jesus
        Christ our Lord.” (Romans 7:24-25, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        As Mohanan entrusted his life to Jesus Christ, he began to experience
        victory over sin. While many believers overcome visible sins like
        drunkenness or adultery after conversion, subtler but equally deadly
        sins—such as selfishness, spiritual pride, envy, and bitterness—often take
        root. Mohanan realised that this lack of humility and honesty perpetuates
        problems within the Church. Zac Poonen’s book further exposed hidden sins
        in Mohanan’s life, leading him to seek refuge in Jesus. Like a loving
        father comforting his child, God reassured and strengthened him.
    </p>

    <p>
        This marked the beginning of a new chapter in Mohanan’s spiritual journey,
        one built on a strong foundation. He recognised the widespread deception
        within the Christian community—emphasising outward acts like tithes and
        offerings while neglecting the weightier matters of truth, righteousness,
        and mercy. Mohanan lamented that many believers blindly accept their
        pastors’ teachings without verifying them against Scripture, a far cry
        from the Bereans who diligently examined the Word.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan does not claim complete victory over sin but acknowledges
        significant progress since realigning his life with Christ. Echoing Paul’s
        words, “I don’t mean to say that I have already achieved these things or
        that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that
        perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me.” (Philippians 3:12,
        NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan observed an unsettling disparity in believers’ faith. While they
        trust God for earthly blessings like jobs, marriages, and wealth, they
        doubt His ability to grant victory over sin. This selective faith grieves
        Mohanan deeply, as Revelation repeatedly promises rewards to those who
        overcome (Revelation 2:7, 17; 3:5, 12, 21, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan emphasises the importance of perseverance in overcoming sin. Just
        as the Israelites were called to drive out the inhabitants of Canaan,
        believers must relentlessly fight against sin with God’s help. The failure
        to do so leads to spiritual stagnation and unfulfilled lives. Mohanan
        urges believers to recognise the destructive power of sins like pride,
        anger, and hypocrisy, resolving to eradicate them with God’s strength.
    </p>

    <p>
        He concludes with a call to action: “Let us come boldly to the throne of
        our gracious God. There we will receive His mercy, and we will find grace
        to help us when we need it most.” (Hebrews 4:16, NLT). Through persistent
        prayer and dependence on God, believers can triumph over sin and
        experience the fullness of life promised in Christ.

    <p id="41" class="chapnum">41</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">Gold Amidst The Dust</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">O</span>ne morning, Thankamani began her daily
        routine in the kitchen after her usual time of prayer. She typically woke
        much earlier than her husband, Mohanan, who would sleep until 7:30 unless
        he planned to travel that day. In those days, they had neither a gas stove
        nor a cylinder, and only limited firewood. Their cooking was done on
        sawdust-fired stoves. Twice a year, they would visit the sawmills to
        collect as much sawdust as they could carry home.
    </p>

    <p>
        That morning, however, Thankamani excitedly woke Mohanan at around 6:30.
        “Look at this!” she exclaimed, her voice brimming with excitement. “Wake
        up and look!” Sleepily, he opened his eyes to see her holding a shining
        gold necklace in front of him.
    </p>

    <p>
        “I found this in the sawdust pile,” she said hurriedly, dropping it onto
        the bed. “Is it real gold, or just fake?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Still groggy, Mohanan examined the necklace and tested it by rubbing it
        across a granite chip from their yard. It was real gold.
    </p>

    <p>
        But instead of joy, Mohanan felt uneasy. The necklace was valuable, and he
        knew it did not belong to them. He placed it on the bed and turned to his
        morning prayers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The thought crept into his mind: “Could this be God’s provision?” It would
        be easy to see it that way, especially since no one else knew they had
        found it. Selling the necklace could help pay off some of his debts—it was
        worth about 6,000 rupees at the time. But his conscience stirred uneasily.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another thought followed: “What if I use the money for charitable work or
        to support the church meals we provide?” Yet even this did not bring
        peace. He began to realise that these were temptations, urging him to act
        in a way that was not pleasing to God.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recognising the enemy’s schemes, Mohanan rebuked the thought aloud: “Get
        behind me, Satan! You are not from God. This is not my necklace, nor is it
        God’s gift to me. It belongs to someone else, and I’ll return it, no
        matter the trouble it may cost me.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Peace flooded his heart as he praised God for guiding him to the right
        decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        After finishing his prayers, Mohanan took the necklace to a jeweller to
        have it weighed. It came to 1.5 sovereigns. He recalled that they had last
        collected sawdust from the mill about eight months earlier. Since they had
        not fully used up the old stock, the new sawdust had been dumped on top of
        it. It seemed likely the necklace had ended up in the pile during the
        previous year’s visit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although he’d no idea how to locate the owner, Mohanan resolved to obey
        God’s command: “You must not steal” (Exodus 20:15, NLT). He began by
        visiting the nearest sawmill, three kilometres away, to enquire if anyone
        had lost something—wood or otherwise. The mill worker said no.
    </p>

    <p>
        Undeterred, Mohanan went to another sawmill. When he asked the same
        question, the owner replied, “I haven’t lost anything, but my friend lost
        a gold necklace here some time ago.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon questioning, the owner explained that his friend had lost it about
        ten months earlier while working at the mill. This matched the timeline.
        Mohanan invited the man, his friend, and a third witness from the mill to
        his house.
    </p>

    <p>
        The man described the necklace’s weight and design in detail, proving his
        ownership. He explained that the necklace had been a gift from his wife on
        their wedding day. It had broken and fallen into the sawdust while he was
        cutting wood, and despite a thorough search, it had not been found.
    </p>

    <p>
        The story aligned perfectly, as Thankamani had discovered the necklace in
        its broken state. Mohanan handed the necklace over, saying, “I follow the
        Lord Jesus Christ, who is the truth of the universe. He teaches us, ‘Do to
        others whatever you would like them to do to you’” (Matthew 7:12, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan encouraged the man to consider the word of truth and be saved. He
        refused to accept any compensation, saying, “I paid only for the sawdust,
        not the gold. As the Lord said, ‘Give as freely as you have received’”
        (Matthew 10:8, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Sadly, Mohanan reflected that many believers misinterpret such situations
        as blessings from God. They happily keep what they find, praising God for
        their dishonest gain, instead of obeying His word.
    </p>

    <p>
        He shared an example: “I once read a ‘testimony’ in a magazine. Two
        believers at a bus stop saw a large package fall from a passing bus. It
        contained two beds and mattresses. After waiting five minutes for someone
        to claim it, they took it home, rejoicing, ‘We prayed for one bed, but God
        gave us two, with mattresses!’ Is this how God provides?
    </p>

    <p>
        “God commands us not to covet or take what belongs to others. If it were
        you who lost the package, would you not search for it in distress? God
        can’t bless disobedience. ‘To obey is better than sacrifice’” (1 Samuel
        15:22, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Such incidents gradually changed the opinions of their neighbours. Though
        Mohanan’s family had faced false accusations, their unwavering honesty and
        faithfulness to God’s word earned them respect.
    </p>

    <p>
        As children of light, Mohanan believed, believers are called to shine in a
        world darkened by dishonesty and greed. Only by living in obedience to
        God’s commands can we truly reflect His glory.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">God’s Unfailing Goodness</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">O</span>ne day, around noon, a brother burst into
        the house shouting, “Praise the Lord!” Without hesitation, he rushed to
        Mohanan and hugged him warmly. This was Ravi Kurup, a man from Kannur who
        had once been an alcoholic but had come to know the Lord several years
        earlier. Ravi had been working abroad for many years and had heard about
        Mohanan through Vijayamohan.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the exuberant greeting, the two sat down and talked for a long
        while. Ravi listened intently, captivated by the many extraordinary
        experiences Mohanan shared. Eventually, Ravi got up and walked around the
        property, inspecting everything. As he was about to leave, he casually
        asked, “Do you have a well?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Indeed, Mohanan and Thankamani had been praying for a well for two years.
        Their water came from a neighbouring property, as they didn’t have one of
        their own.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before leaving, Ravi asked another question: “Can you drive a scooter?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan’s heart stirred. He had been praying for such a vehicle for many
        years. His three-wheeled cycle was difficult to manoeuvre on inclines, and
        he often had to rely on others to help him. Neighbours would sometimes
        remark, “If only this cycle had an engine, life would be much easier for
        you.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan’s response was always the same: “All in God’s good time. I can
        wait.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, it seemed, God’s time had come. Ravi Kurup, moved by Mohanan’s faith
        and perseverance, spoke with some friends. Together, they raised enough
        funds to purchase a scooter for Mohanan. The vehicle was specially
        modified into a four-wheeled scooter, dramatically transforming Mohanan’s
        mobility. Where before he could only travel within a two-kilometre radius,
        now he could visit dozens of other paralysed or disabled individuals,
        bringing them comfort and hope.
    </p>

    <p>
        But Ravi didn’t stop there. He also provided 4,500 rupees for the digging
        of a well. Mohanan immediately tithed 500 rupees, leaving him with 4,000
        rupees. He prayed earnestly, asking the Lord to help them strike water
        before reaching a depth of 27 feet—the maximum depth his budget would
        allow. Trusting in God’s guidance, Mohanan chose the site for the well
        without consulting any local experts.
    </p>

    <p>
        At a nearby location, the water table was much lower, and a spring had
        only been reached after digging to a depth of 39 feet. But at Karunya
        Bhavan, water was struck precisely at 27 feet. Today, that well supplies
        all the water for their home and ministry.

        faith, He does all things well.

        <span class="dropcap">T</span>oo often, believers’ lives are marred by
        sins that are detestable to God: complaints, discontent, envy,
        quarrelling, and jealousy. Such things have no place in the lives of those
        who trust in the Lord and obey Him. Sadly, many are quick to rely on
        others instead of putting their faith in God.

        “It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in people. It is
        better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes” (Psalm

        man will inevitably be let down, for no human—spiritual or otherwise—can
        meet all their needs. But those who trust in the Lord will never be put to
        shame. “But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will
        soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They
        will walk and not faint” (Isaiah 40:31, NLT).

    <p class="lastpara">
        Just as earthly fathers desire to give the best to their children, so does
        our heavenly Father. Yet in His infinite love and wisdom, He doesn’t grant
        every impulsive or immature request. Instead, He waits, orchestrating
        events for our ultimate good. “The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth
        in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him” (2
        Chronicles 16:9, NLT).
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the course of his 37 years as a
        Christian, Mohanan has often wept before the Lord but has never grumbled.
        Instead, he has consistently praised God’s goodness, trusting in His Word.
        There were times when God answered prayers quickly, but on other
        occasions, Mohanan had to wait. And still, there are prayers that remain
        unanswered.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet he rests content, trusting God’s perfect wisdom and timing. “My only
        desire is to humble myself under His hand,” Mohanan says. “No, He doesn’t
        give me everything I ask for. But He has also given me many things I never
        even thought to ask for. Scripture tells me, ‘Truly God is good to Israel,
        to those whose hearts are pure’” (Psalm 73:1, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>He summarises the Christian journey in five steps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Know God</li>
        <li>Believe in God</li>
        <li>Obey God</li>
        <li>Trust in God</li>
        <li>Wait on God</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These steps, Mohanan affirms, will surely lead God’s children to
        experience His goodness and faithfulness. “Taste and see that the Lord is
        good. Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!” (Psalm 34:8, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Even when trials surround us, let us trust in God wholeheartedly, echoing
        David’s words: “Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I’ll not be
        afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and
        comfort me. Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the
        days of my life, and I will live in the house of the Lord forever” (Psalm

    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan reflects on how he came to depend
        entirely on God for all his needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        “About ten years after I came to the faith, I met a Muslim priest who
        asked me how I managed my expenses. I told him that God provided for us,
        but he seemed unconvinced. He repeated the question, pressing for details
        about how we sustained ourselves. I gave him the same answer, and he
        eventually stopped asking.
    </p>

    <p>
        “On another occasion, I shared the gospel with someone I met, and he posed
        the same question. This time, I replied that my wife, Thankamani, had half
        an acre of land in her name, which brought in an income of 7,000 rupees a
        year. I explained that God provided the rest. The man was sceptical,
        doubting whether that modest sum could truly meet all our needs.
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        “As I was heading home, I heard the Lord’s voice asking, ‘Do you really
        manage with your wife’s portion?’ It was then that I realised my mistake.
        God spoke to my heart: ‘I take care of you, so why do you depend on the
        income from Thankamani’s land? Sell that land, and then you can boldly
        proclaim that I am the one who meets all your needs.’”
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        As soon as Mohanan reached home, he asked Thankamani whether they should
        sell her land. Without hesitation, she replied, “As you wish. I don’t need
        any land on earth. Obey what God has told you.” Her willingness to
        surrender everything to God’s leading was a testament to her godly
        character.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan did feel a pang of doubt about selling the land, which was their
        only steady source of income. But looking back, he has no regrets about
        obeying the Lord.
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        The land in Palathinkadavu was sold to Thankamani’s brother for 35,000
        rupees, which was paid in instalments. A portion of this money funded the
        printing of 10,000 gospel tracts and helped arrange Dinesh’s wedding. The
        rest was used to purchase seven cents (approximately 280 square metres) of
        land adjacent to <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, with four cents of it deeded to
        the charitable organisation.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        After the sale, we continued living in Koothuparamba. Most days, we had
        guests in our home. For the last 30 years, we have shared our meals with
        at least two other people daily, yet we have never run out,” Mohanan
        shares.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Karunya Bhavan Charitable Trust for the Disabled</b> was established in
        2003. Monthly expenses for the ministry are around 50,000 rupees. By 2006,
        Mohanan had travelled over 200,000 kilometres by taxi, 32,000 kilometres
        on the scooter God provided, and at least 20,000 kilometres in the Omni
        van that was later donated to the ministry. All these resources, Mohanan
        testifies, were provided by God.
    </p>

    <p>
        “God has always made a way for us. But He asks for our total surrender. If
        we are willing to yield whatever He asks for—even our lives—He will supply
        all our needs. Many proclaim the blessings of Abraham over the life of a
        believer. But few remember that Abraham constantly humbled himself before
        God and obeyed Him with reverent fear. That was the price Abraham paid: he
        gave his life to God.
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        “This is why Scripture says, ‘Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and
        live righteously, and he will give you everything you need’ (Matthew 6:33,
        NLT). And again, ‘Return to me, and I will return to you,’ says the Lord
        of Heaven’s Armies (Zechariah 1:3, NLT). Brothers and sisters, these are
        conditional promises. Without fulfilling the conditions, we can’t
        experience God’s favour. Let us obey His Word.”
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        The living God has given His people many promises. But it is a grave
        misconception to believe these can be claimed through faith alone unless
        that faith is expressed in obedience. The two are inseparable, for ‘those
        who love God will keep His commandments.’
    </p>

    <p>
        “To receive God’s forgiveness, you must forgive your brother. ‘If you
        refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins’ (Matthew
        6:15, NLT). To receive from the Lord, His Word says, ‘Give, and you will
        receive. Your gift will return to you in full—pressed down, shaken
        together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap’
        (Luke 6:38, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        “If you desire wisdom before God, become a fool in the eyes of the world.
        To become strong, embrace your weaknesses. If you wish to be the greatest,
        become the least. If you aspire to be a master, serve others. To wear a
        crown, take up your cross and follow Him. Would you store treasure in
        heaven? Leave everything and follow Him.
    </p>

    <p>
        “These are thought-provoking examples of the conditions underlying every
        promise of God. Many today are eager to believe in Jesus Christ, but God
        requires more than belief. His command is to repent and believe the
        gospel.
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        “Too often, people teach half the truth, saying, ‘Believe in the Lord
        Jesus and you will be saved, along with everyone in your household’ (Acts
        16:31, NLT). But they fail to emphasise that this promise was spoken by
        Paul to the repentant Philippian jailer.”
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        “I have met many people over the past 21 years, but few truly teach,
        practise, or believe God’s Word as it is written. The Bible reveals God as
        true, rich in mercy, full of grace, compassionate, and long-suffering. He
        is holy, and He is love. Yet how many believers live in constant sorrow,
        restlessness, and dissatisfaction?
    </p>

    <p>
        “Far too many live with complaints, discord, and discontentment. They hear
        the Word but fail to obey it. The Lord has said: ‘Not everyone who calls
        out to me, “Lord! Lord!” will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who
        actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter’ (Matthew 7:21,
        NLT).
    </p>

        “It is not enough to read and believe the Word of God. To experience His
        grace, we must obey whatever He has revealed to us. Let your faith be

    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Home of Compassion: It’s Yours to Build!</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan’s journey at Kaithachal began amidst
        severe opposition and poverty. Despite these challenges, he and his wife
        soon began gathering with fellow believers for worship and shared the
        gospel with those God brought into their lives. During this time, Mohanan
        received letters from five different individuals who were paralyzed. One
        letter, in particular, struck a chord. A man wrote that his mother had
        passed away, leaving him with no one to care for him.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moved with compassion, Mohanan prayed, “Lord, if only You would raise
        someone to care for the paralyzed—a home where they could experience love
        and hear the gospel of salvation.” He was aware of charitable
        institutions, but his heart yearned for a haven where the disabled could
        be cared for with brotherly love. God’s response was unexpected: “Build a
        home of compassion yourself.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan was incredulous. “Me? I can’t even afford 15 rupees to fix the
        tyre of my tricycle, which has been unusable for six months! How can a
        paralysed man like me care for others equally, if not more, helpless?”
        Even now, he reflects on the mystery of God’s choice but acknowledges that
        God never makes mistakes. Instead of resisting, Mohanan turned to
        prayer—the only recourse of the weak.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Scripture, Mohanan had often read that what is impossible for man is
        possible with God. He recalled how Abraham, at 99, was promised a son by
        God, despite Sarah’s barrenness. Though the situation seemed laughable,
        Abraham hoped against hope, believing God’s promise. Eventually, Isaac was
        born, and from him came a nation as numerous as the stars in the sky.
    </p>

    <h4>The Birth of a Vision</h4>

    <p>
        Mohanan prayed for four years. Then he met K.P. Girish, a 21-year-old from
        Kozhikode who had been paralysed after falling from a coconut tree at the
        age of 14. They had corresponded for some time, and one day Girish
        expressed his desire to visit Mohanan. Taken aback by the request, Mohanan
        wondered how he could host Girish in his tiny home. Yet, he sensed this
        was the beginning of the mercy home God had placed in his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Girish arrived at <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, there wasn’t even space for
        him to lie down. Around the same time, a widow donated a small sum,
        allowing Mohanan to add a modest room for Girish. Mohanan shared the
        gospel with him, explaining how Jesus had fulfilled the demands of God’s
        love and righteousness on the cross. On the third night, Girish prayed
        with a broken heart, seeking Jesus. It was a deeply moving moment,
        reminiscent of Mohanan’s own conversion. Girish stayed for a year, during
        which time Thankamani cared for him like a mother, and the family prayed
        together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite their limited means, they lacked nothing. When asked how he
        planned to fund the mercy home, Mohanan simply replied, “The God who has
        cared for me these 13 years will care for all who live here.”
    </p>

    <h4>Building the Home of Compassion</h4>

    <p>
        Encouraged by a friend named George, Mohanan began construction with faith
        as his only resource. George advised him to start with eight concrete
        pillars outside his house. Assuming George would help financially, Mohanan
        hired three workers to dig the foundation holes. That day, a postman
        delivered 150 rupees, enabling him to continue hiring labourers the next
        day. When funds ran out, Mohanan prayed, and two visitors unexpectedly
        donated 200 rupees—just enough to pay the workers.
    </p>

    <p>
        For six months, the sight of the unfinished holes was a daily reminder of
        their struggle. Mohanan finally prayed, surrendering the project to God,
        and resolved to fill in the holes the next day if no provision came. That
        very day, he received 5,000 rupees from a stranger in Saudi Arabia. This
        marked the beginning of many miraculous provisions, as God used people to
        supply every need.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time, Mohanan received substantial contributions, including a
        25,000-rupee cheque after sharing his testimony at a church meeting.
        Another donor funded the concrete roof after raising 75,000 rupees from
        his small congregation. Though the actual cost exceeded their estimates,
        God’s faithfulness never wavered. In total, it took four years and 300,000
        rupees to complete the first phase of <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, which housed
        seven beds.
    </p>

    <p>Karunya Bhavan: A Beacon of Hope</p>

    <p>
        By 1999, Mohanan had named his modest house <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>—a
        testament to God’s compassion. In 2003, the vision expanded into the
        <b>Karunya Bhavan Charitable Trust for the Disabled</b>. Since its
        inception, 15 paraplegics have lived there, 10 of whom embraced Christ and
        returned home with newfound hope.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the first residents was Girish. He was soon joined by others like
        Abdul Khader, Rajeevan, and Mathew—each paralysed by tragic accidents.
        Many arrived suicidal, but <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> offered them more than
        physical care; it introduced them to the hope found in Christ.
    </p>

    <p>
        The home also provides practical support, including physiotherapy,
        assistive devices like wheelchairs, and training in self-sufficiency.
        Residents are taught to access government aid and, where possible, learn
        livelihood skills to generate income.
    </p>

    <h4>Faith Beyond Obstacles</h4>

    <p>
        Traveling by scooter or jeep, Mohanan has met nearly 200 paraplegics. His
        encounters have not been without challenges. Once, after leading an RSS
        worker named Prakash to Christ, Mohanan faced threats. Despite this, he
        joked, “I won’t set foot there again—I can’t, being paralysed!”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan reflects on his life with gratitude, saying, “God turned my tragic
        accident and rejection into something meaningful. Trials are like the
        goldsmith’s fire; they refine us for God’s eternal purposes.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> continues its mission, constrained by space
        but not by vision. The family prays for the means to purchase adjacent
        land to expand their work, dreaming of a centre that could accommodate
        thousands of paraplegics.
    </p>

    <p>
        “When God tells you to do something,” Mohanan advises, “don’t
        rationalise—just obey. Move forward in faith, and even the Red Sea will
        part before you.”

        <span class="dropcap">W</span>ho can find a virtuous and capable wife? She
        is more precious than rubies” (Proverbs 31:10, NLT). Mohanan speaks with
        heartfelt emotion about his wife, Thankamani.
    </p>

    <p>
        “By now, you must’ve realised that my life has been far from ordinary,
        both before and after my accident. However, since becoming a paraplegic
        and a Christian, the most significant person in my life and ministry has
        been my wife, Thankamani, whom I affectionately call Thanka. She has stood
        by me in everything I have done, always working quietly behind the scenes.
        While people may praise my efforts, I am certain God values her
        contributions even more.”
    </p>

    <h4>Their Beginning</h4>

    <p>
        Mohanan reflects on the early days: “In my youth, I resolved to marry only
        after turning 25. But life had other plans. I met Thankamani while working
        on a 35-acre estate near her home. At the time, I was an overseer, and she
        caught my eye. I saw in her the qualities of an excellent wife, yet I felt
        it was too soon to consider marriage. Despite my reasoning, her image
        filled my thoughts, and the more I tried to dismiss these feelings, the
        stronger they became. By the age of 23, I approached my parents to propose
        marriage to her.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Initially, her family was hesitant. As the fourth daughter of a poor
        household, she’d worked as a manual labourer from a young age, and they
        felt she did not meet the conventional standards of attractiveness. But my
        criteria were different.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan had devised seven criteria for compatibility in marriage,
        believing that at least five should be met for a union to succeed. “In our
        case,” he said, “all seven were fulfilled. Though I did not yet know God,
        I now believe it was He who brought us together 38 years ago.”
    </p>

    <h4>A Trial of Faith</h4>

    <p>
        Their married life began with joy and dreams for the future, only to be
        shattered by Mohanan’s accident. “I often wonder why my wife had to endure
        so much sorrow,” he confesses. While he was hospitalised, Thankamani’s
        parents pressured her to return to her ancestral home in Trivandrum.
        There, she gave birth to their son, Jayaprakash, on 6 July 1986, enduring
        the pain of separation from her husband. She reunited with Mohanan only
        when their baby was nine months old.
    </p>

    <p>
        “After three long years apart, we began life anew at Palathinkadavu,”
        Mohanan recalls. “Her daily life was unimaginably hard. She worked as a
        manual labourer by day and tended to our cashew plantation. Returning home
        exhausted, she still managed to cook, clean, and care for both our child
        and me. She never went to bed before 11 PM. Watching her struggle, I often
        wept before God, asking, ‘Father, why do You not take me when I am unable
        to ease her burden?’ Yet she never complained. Her cheerful resilience
        carried us through.”
    </p>

    <h4>A Life of Service</h4>

    <p>
        Thankamani’s uncomplaining spirit extended to her submission to her
        husband. Despite being the primary breadwinner, she handed over her wages
        to Mohanan, always consulting him before making any expenditure. “Though
        we had differences before she accepted Christ, she’s now a shining example
        for wives,” Mohanan says.
    </p>

    <p>
        When they moved to Koothuparamba, her unwavering support enabled Mohanan
        to focus on ministry. “I have met paraplegics whose wives abandoned them
        after their disability,” he remarks. “But Thankamani’s life is an example
        of steadfast devotion. Beyond caring for me, she surrendered herself to
        God and supported the establishment of <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, a home for
        the disabled.”
    </p>

    <h4>A God-Given Partnership</h4>

    <p>
        Mohanan draws a parallel with Genesis, where God says, “I will make a
        helper who is just right for him” (Genesis 2:18, NLT). “God gave me
        Thankamani to be my perfect helper,” he says. Her faith and encouragement
        have been a constant source of strength. “During moments of despair, she
        reassures me, saying, ‘Unless these trials had come, we would never have
        known the living God.’ Her unwavering trust in God sustains us, even in
        the hardest times.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thankamani’s work at <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> is a testament to her
        sacrificial spirit. She cooks, cleans, and cares for the residents,
        considering it a service to God rather than a burden. Even after
        undergoing major surgery, she resumed her duties without hesitation.
    </p>

    <h4>A Shared Legacy</h4>

    <p>
        Over nearly four decades, Mohanan and Thankamani have built a life of
        unity and purpose. Their son, Jayaprakash, grew up amidst adversity but
        excelled in his studies and now serves alongside his parents at Karunya
        Bhavan. “Despite limited resources, God has provided for us every day,”
        Mohanan says. “Our family, once seemingly destroyed, has flourished in His
        hands. We have become fruitful, so much so that others envy us.”
    </p>

    <h4>God’s Faithfulness</h4>

    <p>
        Reflecting on their journey, Mohanan quotes Proverbs 18:22: “The man who
        finds a wife finds a treasure, and he receives favour from the Lord”
        (NLT). He also recalls Psalm 128:1-4: “How joyful are those who fear the
        Lord… Your wife will be like a fruitful grapevine, flourishing within your
        home. Your children will be like vigorous young olive trees as they sit
        around your table. That is the Lord’s blessing for those who fear him”
        (NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        The couple’s faith and perseverance have inspired many. Mohanan concludes
        with an invitation: “Friend, how is your family life? Have you received
        Jesus Christ? No matter your difficulties, God can turn your life around
        for His glory.”
    </p>

    <h1 class="chaptitle">A Heritage from God: Our Children</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">C</span>hildren are a gift from the Lord; they are a
        reward from him,” says Psalm 127:3.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan reflects, “Five months after my accident, on July 6, 1986, a son
        was born to us. My wife was deeply distressed, both emotionally and
        physically, by the terrible accident, and as a result, our baby was born
        frail and underweight. In fact, the doctors doubted whether he’d survive.
        It was during this challenging time that I received a Bible, which
        eventually led me to know God. From that moment on, I prayed earnestly for
        my child with a broken heart.”
    </p>

    <p>
        After their son was born, they named him Jayaprakash. Mohanan had to wait
        three years before they could live together as a family. During that time,
        he prepared himself through Scripture to raise his child.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Parents should be deeply concerned about the responsibility of bringing
        children into the world. It is vital to rear them in a way that makes them
        useful and pleasing to both God and humanity. Otherwise, parents will have
        to give an account to God,” he explained.
    </p>

    <p class="quotation">
        Ephesians 6:4 instructs, “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger
        by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and
        instruction that comes from the Lord.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan continued, “God has entrusted mothers with the responsibility of
        bearing children, but fathers hold a great responsibility in raising them.
        Sadly, many children from Christian families fail to live as examples in
        their communities because this duty is not taken seriously. Parents can’t
        shift this responsibility to peers, teachers, or society.”
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        He added, “God gave me just one son, but the word of God provided ample
        wisdom to raise him as a good citizen. When my son was three and a half
        years old, I began supervising his education. Despite my paralysis, I lay
        prone on my mattress and taught him to read and write Malayalam by tracing
        letters in the sand. I explained the importance of learning and began with
        just one letter a day.”
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        Mohanan described an early challenge: “On the third day of our lessons, he
        ran away to his grandparents instead of studying. I called out to him, but
        he knew I couldn’t follow. It broke my heart to see my little boy disobey
        me. I cried out to the Lord, ‘Please make my son a child of God.’”
    </p>

    <p>
        Remembering Proverbs 22:15, “A youngster’s heart is filled with
        foolishness, but physical discipline will drive it far away,” Mohanan
        waited for his son to return. When the boy came back, Mohanan gently
        addressed the disobedience. “He admitted that his grandmother had advised
        him to run to her if I ever threatened discipline. I explained to him that
        obedience was essential and that bad habits would form if he continued to
        disobey. I spanked him with a light cane, four good strokes, for his
        disobedience. ”
    </p>

    <p>
        Discipline, according to Mohanan, is a delicate balance. “Discipline
        should be rooted in love and never in anger. It must be adapted to the
        child’s age and capacity, and always applied privately to spare the
        child’s dignity. Most importantly, parents must live as examples of what
        they teach. A smoker can’t convincingly tell his child not to smoke, nor
        can a habitual liar teach honesty.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He emphasised, “Spanking is often criticised today, but when administered
        judiciously and in love, it can teach valuable lessons. Discipline is not
        about punishment but about guiding children to fear God and develop
        self-control. Proverbs 13:24 reminds us,
        <em>‘Those who spare the rod of discipline hate their children. Those who
            love their children care enough to discipline them.’</em>”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan’s discipline methods were firm yet loving. He recounted, “At the
        age of four, I taught my son to brush his teeth morning and night. One
        night, he forgot, and I woke him up to complete the task. That was the
        last time I ever needed to remind him.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Reflecting on modern parenting challenges, Mohanan lamented, “Child
        psychologists often discourage spanking, labelling it as abuse. But this
        mindset contributes to the widespread indiscipline, irresponsibility, and
        disobedience we see in today’s youth. When children are raised in God’s
        ways, they will never be a burden to their parents, society, or God.”
    </p>

    <p>Mohanan offered advice for parents:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Discipline with love, not anger.</li>
        <li>Tailor discipline to the child’s age and capacity.</li>
        <li>
            Apply discipline privately, focusing on the wrongdoing, not shaming the
            child.
        </li>
        <li>Consult God’s word before disciplining.</li>
        <li>Set a godly example for your children.</li>
        <li>Reassure children of your love after disciplining them.</li>
        <li>Provide for your children’s physical and emotional needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Proverbs 22:6 says, “Direct your children onto the right path, and when
        they are older, they won’t leave it.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohanan concluded with a heartfelt reflection: “When my son was in sixth
        grade, his mother teased him, asking whom he loved more. Without
        hesitation, he said, ‘My father.’ Despite my physical limitations, he
        recognised that my discipline came from love. That moment brought tears of
        gratitude to my eyes. Today, Jayaprakash is a source of pride and joy. He
        lives with integrity, honesty, and devotion to God, qualities rooted in
        the Scriptures and nurtured through love and discipline.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The apostle Paul exhorts, “Children, <em>obey your parents</em> because
        you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do.
        <em>‘Honour your father and mother.’</em> This is the first commandment
        with a promise: If you honour your father and mother, ‘things will go well
        for you, and you will have a long life on the earth.’” (Ephesians 6:1-3
        NLT)
    </p>

    <p>
        In closing, Mohanan urged, “Honouring parents is God’s command, even if
        they are uneducated or frail. Children must love and respect their parents
        as an expression of their obedience to God. When we follow Christ’s
        example, we glorify God through our relationships within the family.”

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Embrace Loss, Endure Pain</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">M</span>ohanan’s narrative takes us deeper into the
        profound journey of faith, resilience, and hope. He recounts with great
        emotion:
    </p>

    <p>
        June 15, 2005, marked a pivotal day in our lives. For 15 long years, we
        had endured severe hardships while living in Koothuparamba. Brother
        Skariah encouraged me to seek a plot of land where we could live
        peacefully as a family. He emphasised that it should be away from the
        hustle and bustle of the roadside, free from the din and dust of passing
        traffic. By God’s grace, we found a plot situated 30 metres away from the
        main road—exactly as we had hoped.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our neighbour initially welcomed the Word of God with enthusiasm. He was a
        man with a 40-year history of alcoholism. After attending our meetings, he
        quit drinking and joined our gatherings for seven years. However, his
        family, though eager for his sobriety, opposed his newfound faith.
        Eventually, they drew him back into his former ways.
    </p>

    <p>
        During his years of faith, he allowed us to use the footpath over his
        property. When he stopped attending our meetings, his family asked us to
        stop using the path. Although we could have pursued a legal complaint, we
        believed in entrusting everything to our Lord.
    </p>

    <p>
        For 14 years, we prayed earnestly for an access pathway to our property
        but saw no visible results. We even approached this neighbour, offering to
        purchase an eight-foot-wide strip of land for a fair price, but he refused
        to sell or allow its use. It was clear this opposition was an attempt to
        hinder the mission of <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This reminded me of how the Israelites, on their way to the Promised Land,
        were denied passage through the territories of King Sihon and King Og.
        Similarly, our neighbours refused even a small favour, such as allowing a
        telephone cable to pass through their land. Feeling utterly helpless, I
        poured my heart out to God:
        <i>‘Father, I’ve reached the end of my strength. Please grant us an access
            road to the house.’</i>
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        Prompted by this plea, I visited a man living five kilometres away who
        owned 13.5 cents (546 square metres) of land adjacent to
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>. This land had been on the market for 15 years. When
        I enquired, he quoted a price of 10,000 rupees per cent. Despite warnings
        from our neighbours not to sell to us, the Spirit urged me, ‘My time has
        come. Finalise the deal.’ Though I had no funds, I trusted God and agreed.
        With contributions from 10 brothers, each giving 10,000 rupees, we secured
        the purchase. Thus, <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> gained a permanent access road.
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        This new land lacked a boundary wall. During the survey prior to its sale,
        another neighbour falsely claimed part of the plot as his own, adding 1.5
        cents (about 60 square metres) to his property. He obstructed the
        surveyors from proceeding according to the official map. Trusting in God,
        I chose not to dispute this claim and accepted the reduced area of 12
        cents. This neighbour essentially gained 10,000 rupees worth of land at no
        cost.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many curious onlookers gathered to witness how we would react. But we
        adhered to God’s command to avoid quarrels.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the Bible says in Hebrews 10:32–34,<a id="ref007" href="#fn007">*</a>
        we decided to suffer loss. We acted on this faith, knowing that our
        eternal home is in heaven, not on this earth.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hold no grudge against the neighbour who encroached on our property. His
        young son, unaware of his father’s actions, continued to visit us,
        spending his days playing in our yard and enjoying our company. Looking
        into his innocent eyes, I asked myself, ‘Why can’t I be like this child?’
        Jesus reminds us, ‘Unless you turn from your sins and become like little
        children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven.’ This conviction
        enabled us to pray sincerely for the family, without bitterness. We even
        set aside the produce of the disputed land for their use, showing them
        love and grace, just as before.
    </p>

    <p>The Bible teaches us:</p>

    <p class="quotation">
        ‘Dear friends, I warn you as temporary residents and foreigners to keep
        away from worldly desires that wage war against your very souls. Be
        careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbours. Then even if
        they accuse you of doing wrong, they will see your honourable behaviour,
        and they will give honour to God when he judges the world.’ (1 Peter
        2:11–12, NLT). If we consistently obey such exhortations, how many
        disputes among believers would cease?
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        Many people claim it is impossible to live among hard-hearted,
        unsympathetic neighbours. I disagree. Human nature is flawed everywhere,
        but when our reactions are rooted in God’s Word, many problems resolve.
        The Bible assures us: ‘Now, who will want to harm you if you are eager to
        do good?’ (1 Peter 3:13, NLT). By following this principle, we can prevent
        harm and glorify God.”
    </p>

    <h4>A Tale of Greed and the Gospel</h4>
    <p>
        Years ago, I visited Vijayamohan early one morning. A pastor, whom I had
        met only once before, was already there. Intrigued by his presence at such
        an early hour, I inquired about the reason for his visit. He explained
        that he was on his way to the land registry office, entangled in a
        property dispute with his own family. They were, in his words, attempting
        to “grab” his land.
    </p>

    <p>
        I suggested, “Simply tell them, ‘If you go to the left, I’ll go to the
        right.’” In other words, I encouraged him, in accordance with God's word,
        to yield to his family's wishes. (Genesis 13:9)
    </p>

    <p>
        He leapt to his feet, visibly agitated, and demanded to know if I truly
        meant he should relinquish all claims to the property.
    </p>

    <p>“Yes,” I replied, “<em>that’s</em> the Christian way.”</p>

    <p>
        Trembling with fury, he declared, “I have two daughters. I’ll never allow
        anyone to take my property. I’ll take my seven brothers to court. Not one
        shall escape.”
    </p>

    <p>
        I was taken aback. I inquired about the size of the land in question,
        assuming it must be several acres to justify such intense anger. To my
        astonishment, the dispute concerned a mere seven cents of land – less than
        285 square metres. Eight siblings, along with their mother, were all
        laying claim to a share. How far Christians have fallen! An ordained
        minister was prepared to drag his own mother and brothers before the
        courts over a fraction of land!
    </p>

    <p>
        Is this the evidence of salvation, of deliverance from sin? Are such
        individuals truly heirs of heaven? Will the Lord Jesus Christ return to
        gather such people to Himself? We must scrutinise our own hearts and
        examine our actions, lest we ourselves be judged. Remember, the Judge
        stands at the door.
    </p>

    <p>
        The situation in the Corinthian church was no different! As the Apostle
        Paul wrote,
    </p>

    <p class="quotation">
        “But brother goes to law against brother—and that before unbelievers! The
        fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have already been
        completely defeated. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
        Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your
        brothers and sisters!” (1 Corinthians 6:6-8, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        When Paul warned that “because of them the word of God is blasphemed,” he
        may have been foreseeing the future through the Holy Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
        I make these observations after a lifetime dedicated to faith. If these
        words have resonated with you, pour out your heart before God and repent.
        (2 Corinthians 7:10). Whoever you are – high or low, rich or poor, learned
        or unlearned, man or woman – I yearn for you to know the truth, as I did.
        We are all sinners, and the only path to salvation lies through Jesus
        Christ, our Lord. I invite you to find salvation through Jesus, to
        experience liberation from sin and its curse.
    </p>

    <p>
        If, like me, you live with a disability, let this testimony reassure you
        that you are not the result of a mistake. God did not err in your life. If
        a vessel in the potter's hands becomes misshapen, he does not discard it.
        Instead, he reshapes it into something beautiful. God can do the same for
        you. The Lord who created all things can fill your emptiness. The
        compassionate gaze of Jesus Christ is upon you; you are precious and
        valuable in His sight.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dear reader, this life is fleeting, with all its joys and sorrows. But
        there is a life that endures forever – eternal life. One of those who
        loved God wrote, “I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” He knew
        he’d live eternally in heaven, in the house of the Lord. This blessed hope
        is shared only by those who have found Jesus Christ to be their Lord and
        Saviour, those who know their sins are forgiven through Him.
    </p>

    <p>
        I sought God with all my heart, traversing the seas in search of Him. Yet
        He was not found here, nor there, nor in the desert. How profound these
        words are! Mankind desperately seeks God, embarking on pilgrimages and
        making offerings, hoping for peace and consolation. But these actions
        can’t bring forgiveness, peace, or salvation. Jesus calls, “Let anyone who
        thirsts come to me and drink. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life
        freely.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Jesus also says, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not
        give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do
        not be afraid.” God's children inherit an invaluable peace and joy, a
        peace the world can’t give or take away. This is the peace people yearn
        for, and it can’t be found in alcohol, drugs, movies, or any other
        distraction. It is Jesus who bestows peace upon those who believe in Him,
        and they will behold the glory of God, even while still living on earth,
        for they are made children of God.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Jesus, I am a sinner. You bore the punishment for my sin, even unto
        death. I believe you were buried and rose again. Please forgive my sins
        and save me. From this day forward, I’ll live for You. You are my Saviour
        and Lord.” .
    </p>

    <p>
        If anyone prays this from their heart, the Lord Jesus will save them in
        that very moment. I know, from my own experience, that the Lord is good,
        faithful, and always keeps His word. Thankamani, Jayaprakash, and all who
        find refuge in Karunya Bhavan echo this testimony, as do I.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is no one like Jesus Christ, who accepted us, who loves us despite
        our imperfections, and who desires to take us home to heaven. All
        religions teach rituals and rules, but they can’t save anyone or offer
        solutions to the problems people face. In fact, religion often creates
        more problems. This is not the case with the Lord Jesus Christ, who stands
        at the door of your heart, waiting for you to open it and allow Him to
        enter.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are struggling, even contemplating suicide, please know that this
        is not the answer. The solution to your troubles is found in Jesus Christ,
        who is overflowing with love. Will you open your heart and receive Him?

    <h1 class="chaptitle">Behold, My Servant Whom I Uphold!</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he COVID-19 pandemic reached its peak in
        2021, and during that time, I was responsible for the daily care of the
        twenty-two residents at <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>. I required 100,000 rupees
        each month to maintain operations, yet I had no reliable sources of
        income. At that point, our average income was less than 50,000 rupees.
    </p>

    <p>
        To address this financial challenge, I devised what seemed like a viable
        plan. I decided to leverage a government scheme in which ten disabled
        individuals would each receive two goats to rear, provided by the local
        panchayat. I assumed responsibility for caring for the goats, herding them
        with my tricycle. Over the next three years, the goats multiplied, and I
        eventually had a flock of 35.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the prolonged hours spent on the tricycle took a toll on my
        paralysed lower body. I developed ulcers that soon became infected,
        discharging pus. I shivered with fever, spending much of my day in bed.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had frequently undertaken long journeys to collect disabled individuals
        who required more care than their families could provide, bringing them to
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>. On one such trip during the pandemic, I travelled
        to Kozhikode. There was no opportunity to stop for a break before
        returning to Kannur, as every home was closed due to the fear of
        infection. I ended up driving for twelve consecutive hours.
    </p>

    <p>
        That evening, I was utterly exhausted, and my fever had intensified. A
        large area over my lower buttocks, approximately the size of a man’s hand,
        had become swollen and excruciatingly painful. I was too ill to eat, and
        for a week, the swelling and pain persisted unabated.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the seventh day, I felt extremely weak. A dear friend of mine from
        Kozhikode, a brother named Prakashan, called and urged me to consult a
        doctor, as Jayaprakash had been advising me to do for some time.
        Prakashan, whom we affectionately called ‘Homoeo’ Prakashan, had sustained
        a leg injury as a young man when he fell into a well. He had come to
        Karunya Bhavan years ago, where we had cared for him, and there, he
        received the Lord Jesus into his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prakashan had already booked an appointment with a doctor in Kozhikode. I
        was concerned about the hospital expenses, but Prakashan reassured me,
        saying that God would provide – all I needed to do was commence my
        journey.
    </p>

    <p>
        That same day, I was admitted to the Cooperative Hospital in Kozhikode. I
        was trembling with chills as the doctor conducted a preliminary
        examination. He summoned both a surgeon and a plastic surgeon, and they
        ordered numerous tests and scans. Despite being administered intravenous
        antibiotics and other medications, my condition deteriorated. The inflamed
        area had transformed into a large abscess that grew more severe each day.
        I was unable to sleep or even lie down comfortably and barely ate
        anything.
    </p>

    <p>
        For three days, there were no private rooms available. I had been
        utilising a waterbed for the past 25 years to protect my fragile skin, but
        now, an ordinary mattress caused me intense pain, particularly when it
        pressed against the inflamed area. On the tenth day, my condition worsened
        further. My blood pressure plummeted, my haemoglobin levels were at just 8
        g%, instead of the normal 13 g%, and my body was growing weaker.
    </p>

    <p>
        My throat felt as dry as a desert, and my tongue was stiff. I attempted to
        call my son, who had been resting at the foot of my bed after caring for
        me alone for days, but no sound emerged. In desperation, I feebly threw a
        pillow at him. When he awoke, I gestured for a sip of water. After
        drinking, I found I could speak again. I told him I felt as though I was
        already standing at the gates of death. If the abscess was not drained
        that day, I feared I would perish.
    </p>

    <p>
        My son did not speak but gently turned me onto the other side. He was
        deeply distressed. As I lay there, I prayed to the Lord:
        <i>“Lord, if you call me, I will come. But please, allow me to complete
            the work you entrusted to me. Let me assist these vulnerable individuals
            in achieving their goals. Will you grant me a little more time?”</i>
        My heart ached as tears streamed from my eyes, and I prayed earnestly in
        silence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, the Holy Spirit spoke to me: “My plans for you are not for evil but
        for good.” I understood that this trial was permitted by God for a
        purpose. He revealed to me the shortcomings in my life. I had become
        distracted from the work He had originally called me to, focusing instead
        on herding goats and farming. As I reflected, I also recognised other
        weaknesses within myself. I was near death, and my heart broke in
        repentance. But God comforted me, assuring me of His presence.
    </p>

    <p>
        We had exhausted every option to secure a private room, but it was not
        until the following day that one became available. How relieved I was to
        finally lie on the waterbed again! It immediately alleviated much of my
        agony. That same day, the abscess was drained. The surgeon later informed
        me that the pus had gushed out like water from a bowl. It required five
        litres of sterile water to thoroughly cleanse the abscess cavity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next day, I returned to the operating room where the wound was cleaned
        again, with the same meticulous care as before. A pump was inserted to
        ensure proper drainage, and it remained there for the next 15 days. During
        this time, I was constantly administered intravenous antibiotics and
        infusions.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the third day, the surgeon explained the seriousness of the situation.
        The abscess had grown so large that it was pressing against the rectum,
        and if left untreated, it could have ruptured, likely resulting in my
        death. Instead, it had burrowed deeper along the side of the rectum,
        ultimately saving my life. The surgeon declared that God had spared me
        from death.
    </p>

    <p>
        For 18 days, I battled a fever and chills, and I could not tolerate solid
        food. I was receiving two injections worth 250 rupees each, twice a day.
        At the end of this time, the infection was under control. The pus ceased
        draining, my fever subsided, and for the first time in a month, I felt
        hungry again.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout my hospitalisation, Prakashan remained my source of strength.
        He and his wife, Sija, brought home-cooked meals to me every day for the
        22 days I was in hospital, disregarding their own disabilities. They were
        like my own children, gently encouraging me to eat just a little, even
        during the most difficult days.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the 21st day, I knew I would soon be discharged. The hospital bills
        were substantial, with the medication alone costing 23,000 rupees. During
        my illness, I had not given much thought to the cost of my treatment, but
        others had been praying for me. One of these was P G Vargis from Delhi,
        who not only prayed for me but also shared my need with his friends.
        Through their prayers and support, God provided all that I required.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end, 100,000 rupees were deposited into my account from various
        friends and organisations. This amount covered the hospital bill of 71,000
        rupees, the medication and medical equipment bill of 26,000 rupees, and
        the fuel costs for my return trip.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is how God cares for His children. Hallelujah! We need not worry, for
        we can cast all our anxieties upon Him, knowing He cares for us. If we
        claim this promise, we will see that He does all things well.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I returned to <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, the residents were delighted to
        see me, though I was little more than skin and bones. Over the next two
        months, I regained my health. I had to lie on my stomach during this time,
        with our nurse dressing the wounds daily. The wounds gradually diminished
        in size, but they remained open.
    </p>

    <p>
        I considered my options. There was a renowned hospital in Mangalore, but
        the pandemic restrictions made crossing the Karnataka border challenging,
        and the fees were exorbitant. It was then that I met Jayakrishnan, who ran
        a palliative care centre in Melukavu, Idukki. He recommended that I
        consult his friend, Dr. Shaji Mathew, a skilled plastic surgeon in
        Thrissur. Dr. Shaji offered to introduce me, which led to my admission at
        Vincent de Paul Hospital in Ollur, Thrissur.
    </p>

    <p>
        I travelled to Thrissur by car, lying curled up in the backseat, unable to
        sit due to the unhealed wound. Once at the hospital, Dr. Shaji recommended
        a phased surgical approach to repair the wound using muscle and skin
        grafts. The first operation was performed the following day, covering one
        side of the wound with skin.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the third day, in a five-hour procedure, both large wounds were grafted
        with skin. During the recovery period, I lay prostrate, awaiting the
        grafts to heal. By God’s grace, and through the prayers of many, the
        wounds healed well, despite my being diabetic. Dr. Shaji visited me daily,
        even on Sundays.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was discharged on the ninth day, with 40,000 rupees, the proceeds from
        the sale of five goats. The hospital bills should have been significantly
        higher, but Dr. Shaji graciously waived his entire fee of 65,000 rupees.
        His kindness was beyond words, and I will always be grateful, praying for
        God’s blessings on him and his family.
    </p>
    <h4>A Time of Restoration</h4>
    <p>
        I stayed with Brother James, the managing director of Ebenezer Printers,
        for sixteen more days in Thrissur. We had all we needed. People visited us
        daily, and Brother James’s family, along with relatives, took turns
        bringing us freshly cooked meals.
    </p>

    <p>
        While lying on my side, God enabled me to participate in several online
        meetings. I also continued to oversee the affairs of
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> by phone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout this time, my son, Jayaprakash, proved to be a pillar of
        strength. He cared for me in every way, without a word of complaint, and
        with immense joy. He has received God’s grace and matured into a man of
        great value, in contrast to many young men who squander their lives,
        bringing grief to their parents and becoming unproductive to society and
        to God. As the Bible says, “Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a
        reward from him.”
    </p>

    <p>
        During these days of adversity, I relearned many life lessons and
        experienced the profound truth of God’s word. Romans 8:28 states, “And we
        know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who
        have been called according to his purpose.”
    </p>

    <p>
        I was hospitalised for a total of forty-five days, and after my discharge,
        I remained bedridden for another five months. These restrictions were
        divinely ordained. God’s aim in all our trials is to restore and correct
        us. Suffering helps us align our spiritual lives. As God’s word says, “For
        it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him,
        but also to suffer for him.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Among other things, I ceased raising goats and disengaged from farming,
        recognising that these distractions had diverted me from my primary
        calling. Many visitors came during this time, and others offered support
        in various ways.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately, with God’s help, we repaid the remaining debts—150,000 rupees,
        encompassing bank loans and private debts. We were also able to assist
        others in settling at least part of their debts. Additionally, we
        contributed 50,000 rupees as a down payment on a used car for a family
        that had been part of our church for years.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the life of Job, suffering led to significant blessings. The same has
        been true for me. Many predicted that my illness would culminate in death,
        but instead, I have resumed my travels. I have met numerous sick
        individuals and spoken at various gatherings. Recently, I drove 650
        kilometres solo to Marthandam, near Thiruvananthapuram.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we encounter hardship and suffering, we must not murmur but entrust
        ourselves to God. For it is “through many tribulations that we must enter
        the kingdom of God.” We are appointed to endure hardship, whether
        sickness, poverty, or persecution, or even humiliation, abuse, slander,
        contempt, or oppression. Whatever it may be, God is drawing us closer to
        Himself through it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Conversely, prosperity often leads people astray from God. Paul reminds us
        that the afflictions of this present time are insignificant when compared
        to the glory that is to come. “But if you suffer as a Christian, do not be
        ashamed, but glorify God that you bear that name.” My friend, if you are
        suffering, place your trust in God, for He will surely comfort you.
    </p>

    <!--##########################################################-->

    <p id="49" class="chapnum">49</p>
    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Expansion Of The <i>House Of Compassion</i></h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">K</span>arunya Bhavan was officially registered as
        an institution on 16th March 2004. Although I had heard God’s calling
        years before, telling me, “Start <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>,” the task seemed
        utterly impossible. Disabled and helpless as I was, it seemed nothing more
        than a distant dream. Yet, as with Joseph, whose dream was fulfilled
        through immense struggles, my own dream, entrusted to me by God, would
        also come to fruition after much hardship. For years, I held this vision
        in my heart, and finally, it became a reality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> housed just three people who were
        paralysed. Our monthly needs were around 6,000 rupees, but that first
        month, we received only 1,500 rupees. Financial difficulties soon hit us
        hard, and by the 25th of the month, we were struggling to make ends meet.
        I had no other recourse but to pray. There was no logical way forward—how
        could a man who himself was paralysed, with half his body lifeless,
        possibly care for other paralysed people?
    </p>

    <p>
        On the 27th, I prayed fervently, “O God, I began this institution at Your
        command. You must grant me the 5,000 rupees I need to meet the rest of
        this month’s expenses. I need it in cash by the 29th.”
    </p>

    <p>
        This is how I always prayed—openly, honestly, sharing my heart with God.
        With the 30th approaching, bills for groceries, electricity, telephone,
        and wages were all due. I had no time to clear a cheque, and urgently
        needed the cash.
    </p>

    <p>
        At 5 pm on the 29th, I went to the local post office to collect a money
        order. The postman began to count out various notes and coins. When he
        finished, he said, “I think I’ve counted out 5,000 rupees.”
    </p>

    <p>
        I counted it myself—and indeed, it was the exact amount. I looked at the
        postman, amazed. He explained, “I didn’t go to the Head Post Office today.
        I had to collect all the spare cash I had here to make up this amount.
        Sensible people don’t send such large sums by money order because of the
        high commission.”
    </p>

    <p>
        It was clear that God had provided precisely what I needed, in a manner
        that defied logic. The story of God’s work throughout the Bible— from
        Genesis to Revelation—speaks of a God whose ways surpass human
        understanding. When there is sincere faith in God, He moves in ways that
        transcend our reason. God, ever faithful to His word, supplied all our
        needs by the 30th. The postman, though unaware, was God’s instrument that
        day.
    </p>

    <p>
        If God gives us a vision, a dream, or a calling, we can echo the words of
        the Psalmist in unshakable faith:
        <i>“I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help come from? My
            help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth”</i>
        (Psalm 121:1-2 NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        This truth stands firm, even when everything around us defies reason. It
        is through faith that
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> has continued to grow, by God’s grace, and I praise
        God for the many ways His mighty hand has supported the children here.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first building of <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> could only accommodate five
        beds. By 2008, we had no choice but to put two people per bed, much like a
        government hospital. As the number of disabled people needing care grew, I
        found myself praying for more space.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, unexpectedly, a brother sent a contribution of 25,000 rupees. As I
        sought God’s direction, I felt His gentle encouragement to move forward.
        Just five days later, another brother from Trivandrum called to request
        our bank details. Two days later, I was at the bank and discovered that
        50,000 rupees had been transferred into our account. None of these
        brothers were wealthy—they were simple people with humble jobs, yet God
        moved in their hearts to provide.
    </p>

    <p>
        With this money, we purchased 1,500 kg of steel rebar for the next phase
        of construction. The material was stored on site, and I continued to pray.
    </p>

    <p>
        Around this time, the bank offered loans for cement, but each person was
        only eligible for a loan of 20,000 rupees. Even if both I and my wife
        Thankamani applied, we would only receive 40,000 rupees—barely enough to
        continue the work. However, a neighbour agreed to apply in her name as
        well. Initially, the bank rejected the arrangement, but I explained the
        situation to the manager, saying, “If you believe in honesty, please help
        me with these loans. God will provide the means to repay every penny.”
        After a moment’s thought, the manager agreed.
    </p>

    <p>
        By God’s grace, we secured a loan and bought 250 bags (12.5 tons) of
        cement. At the same time, contributions from others continued to pour in,
        both large and small, as they were moved by God. It was just as in the
        days of Nehemiah, when the people were stirred to rebuild the walls of
        Jerusalem. The day before we were set to lay the concrete roof, the chief
        mason informed me that we needed 40,000 rupees. I had nothing at that
        moment but prayed earnestly.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next day, a brother, whose job was quite ordinary, called to inquire
        about the progress of the construction. After our conversation, he asked
        me to visit him when I next came to Kannur. As it happened, I had business
        in Kannur the following day. He said, “In that case, we’ll meet tomorrow.”
    </p>

    <p>
        When I arrived at his flat, he and his wife greeted me and handed me an
        envelope. I opened it immediately and was overwhelmed to find a cheque for
        100,000 rupees. It was a miracle. I was so moved that I could hardly
        speak, and I simply prayed with them, thanking God for His provision.
        Words of gratitude seemed inadequate.
    </p>

    <p>
        God worked in similar ways, and with His help, we were able to build a
        second floor for <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, increasing the capacity to 12
        beds. Nothing is impossible for God. We need not look abroad for help; God
        provides in His own way. “The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in
        order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him” (2
        Chronicles 16:9 NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        In these ways, God has shown His faithfulness, and <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>
        continues to grow, all to the glory of His name.

    <h1 class="chaptitle">The Ways God Opens For Us</h1>
    <p class="firstpara">
        <span class="dropcap">I</span> have been led through many incredible paths
        over the last 37 years since my paralysis. The fourth edition of this book
        was printed in 2019, and now, in 2023, it is being reprinted once again.
        This chapter highlights some key events that took place in the intervening
        years.
    </p>

    <p>
        During this time, I met many old friends, and I have now personally
        visited 537 paralyzed individuals across Kerala, bringing some of them to
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> to care for them. However, the space at
        <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> is limited.
    </p>

    <p>
        To comply with government regulations and qualify for aid, we must meet
        certain requirements, such as having a separate kitchen, dining hall,
        office, medicine room, storeroom, two toilets, a well, and a kitchen work
        area. Unfortunately, we had no means of meeting these regulations.
    </p>

    <p>
        I often prayed, “Lord, please grant me five cents of land next to this
        institution.” At times, the Devil would mock me, saying, “What you are
        praying for is impossible. The owner of that land will never sell it to
        you. He dislikes you because you purchased the 13 cents of land he’d his
        heart set on.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But beloved brothers and sisters, when we pray in faith, the Devil will
        always attempt to weaken our trust with negative thoughts. It is essential
        to remember that he is a liar, the father of lies. God, on the other hand,
        is the truth and speaks only truth. Let us place our trust in Him.
    </p>

    <p>
        One day, I received a visit from the mother of the very man who owned the
        land I sought. She offered to give me the five cents of land that was her
        daughter’s share. I was astonished, for this was the answer to many days
        of prayer. This moment underscored the importance of believing in God, who
        can do anything, instead of listening to the lies of the enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, our challenges were not yet over. Knowing our urgent need to
        expand <i>Karunya Bhavan</i>, the landowner demanded an exorbitant price
        of 120,000 rupees per cent, significantly above the market value of
        80,000. After much negotiation, we agreed on 110,000 per cent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite the struggle, God facilitated the purchase, though it left us in
        debt. Yet, God, who performs the impossible, provided for our needs
        according to our faith. We still faced the daunting task of funding the
        construction. We shared our vision with the church, trusting that the
        estimated three million rupees required would be provided. All we had was
        faith.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hebrews 11:1 (NLT) tells us, “Faith shows the reality of what we hope for;
        it is the evidence of things we cannot see.” In this situation, I
        witnessed God’s remarkable hand at work. At every stage of construction,
        we prayed, and God answered. We never had even a hundred thousand rupees
        available at any one time. Yet, God consistently provided the funds for
        building materials and workmen’s wages precisely when needed. It was at
        this juncture that the COVID-19 pandemic struck. We had just completed the
        roof of the new building and had limited resources to continue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Towards the end of March 2021, Chandran, our laterite brick supplier,
        informed us that high-quality bricks were available. “Shall I deliver them
        to the site?” he asked. I explained our financial constraints but
        suggested he proceed <em>if</em> he could wait for payment. He delivered a
        truckload on Wednesday.
    </p>

    <p>
        That Friday, while reviewing our accounts, Chandran called in the
        afternoon, requesting the 8,000 rupees owed. Despite my prior warning
        about a potential delay, he insisted on immediate payment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shortly after, the foreman called, requesting wages for the workmen to be
        paid the following morning, Saturday. I wondered how I would manage these
        demands and remained silent. Outsiders sometimes assume we are wealthy
        simply because, by God’s grace, we live as though we have everything,
        despite possessing little.
    </p>

    <p>
        I prayed, “O God, I have no helper but you. I owe these people this money.
        Even if he agreed to wait, I am still in debt for 8,000 rupees. Please, do
        not let them blaspheme your name. Amen.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Just as I resumed my bookkeeping, the phone rang. It was a brother, an
        offshore marine engineer, calling from a ship off Mumbai. He had seen my
        interview on YouTube, shared by Harvest TV. He told me that the message I
        shared had deeply impacted him, and he asked for the Trust’s bank details.
        Five minutes later, 30,000 rupees had been credited to our account!
    </p>

    <p>
        This is God’s way, His provision. That day, Friday, 29th March, was the
        last working day before a series of public holidays. Had the money arrived
        even a day later, it would’ve been recorded in the following year’s
        accounts. How precise is God’s awareness of our needs!
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        The Bible instructs us not to worry, but to
        <em>“seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he
            will give you everything you need. So don’t worry about tomorrow, for
            tomorrow will bring its own worries.”</em>
        (Matthew 6:33).
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        The story continues. As the pandemic gripped the world and lockdowns were
        implemented, much work remained on the new building. We continued to pray.
        Over the past 35 years, the Bible has taught me that what is impossible
        for humans is possible with God. He can work tirelessly and unimpeded
        through the greatest difficulties and distress. Jesus Christ never
        abandons those who call upon Him. Whatever the circumstances, those who
        seek Him will never be put to shame (Romans 10:11).
    </p>

    <p>
        Just one week after the miracle of the 30,000 rupees, another message
        appeared on my phone. A donation of 100,000 rupees had been credited to
        the account. It seemed almost unbelievable. I sent a voice message to
        express my gratitude. I immediately summoned the plasterers to continue
        the work. But the funds were still not enough to complete the project.
    </p>

    <p>
        A week later, another miracle occurred. Another 100,000 rupees was
        transferred, all from the same individual. I was speechless with
        gratitude. My voice trembled as I sent my thanks. He responded, saying
        that he’d simply done what God had instructed him to do, and that all
        thanks should go to God. Indeed, Jesus meant it when He said,
        <i>“If you believe, you will see the glory of God.”</i> Nothing is
        impossible for the God who created heaven and earth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Around this time, a Muslim man from Panoor came to see us. When he saw
        that the building needed a tiled floor, he ordered 2,500 square feet of
        tiles in various patterns. It was remarkable how, even during the
        pandemic, the construction at <i>Karunya Bhavan</i> proceeded steadily.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the world grappled with uncertainty and fear, God provided everything
        we needed. Even while work was ongoing, another 50,000 rupees was credited
        to our account.
    </p>

    <p class="lastpara">
        A neighbour remarked, “Mohan, it seems you’re the only one with money to
        spend these days. For months, we’ve had no work or wages. No business is
        being done.” But what was happening wasn’t due to our own efforts or
        religious observances. It was a result of our unwavering faith in God. As
        Romans 10:12 tells us, “For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
        will be saved.”
    </p>

    <p class="firstpara">
        Thus, while the world was engulfed in trouble, tears, and fear of death,
        the living God accomplished the building of a home for these vulnerable
        children of His. How magnificent is the path He opens for those who choose
        to walk the straight and narrow way! Remember His promise, “Open your
        mouth wide, and I will fill it.” People marvel at how easily our financial
        needs are met, assuming we receive funding from abroad. No, my friend,
        God’s children have no distinction between home and foreign land; all is
        His.
    </p>

    <p>
        Will you entrust your life to the true God? Will you believe in Him? Will
        you wait on Him? Truly, “those who wait on the Lord will find new
        strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not
        grow weary. They will walk and not faint.” (Isaiah 40:31, NLT).
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, as the Apostle Paul says of us in 2 Corinthians 6:8-10,
        regardless of how the world perceives us, we are always truthful and
        genuinely consistent, whether honoured or disgraced, whether slandered or
        praised. We are “known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live
        on; beaten, and yet not killed; sorrowful, yet ever rejoicing; poor, yet
        making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.”
    </p>

    <p>
        As this book goes into its first English edition and third Malayalam
        edition, I reflect on how the number of paraplegics I have personally
        visited has grown fivefold. There are many more like them around the
        world—people imprisoned by their disabilities, often with no one to care
        for them. Some are young, paralysed from the neck down, alienated from
        their families.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we focus only on our own comforts, we will never notice such people.
        But they, too, are human beings, with souls and spirits more precious than
        the world itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        God has bestowed upon His children health, intelligence, abilities,
        wealth, and many other advantages so that they can be used according to
        His will, leading to an eternal weight of glory. If we set aside even a
        fraction of what we spend on unnecessary luxuries or desires, and of our
        possessions, as well as a portion of what we save for our children and
        grandchildren, it would be more than sufficient to help these helpless
        people. This would give us the joy of seeing at least some of them sharing
        the Lord’s table with us for eternity.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we are resolute in our commitment to help these individuals by
        addressing their spiritual, emotional, and physical needs, God will
        undoubtedly strengthen us. God’s people are saved to be zealous for good
        works, although it is not these works that earn their salvation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Will you join us in prayer? Will you demonstrate mercy and compassion? God
        observes all our actions. The priest and the Levite callously ignored the
        man who fell victim to robbers, was beaten, and left for dead by the
        roadside. Yet, he survived because of the compassion of a Samaritan—a man
        despised by the religious establishment.
    </p>

    <p>
        My heart yearns to welcome more people living with paralysis to Karunya
        Bhavan, but our current facilities simply can’t accommodate them. The Lord
        has said, “Go and learn what this means:
        <em>‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’”</em> (Matthew 9:13). As James 2:13
        says, “There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to
        others. But if you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges
        you. <em>Mercy triumphs over judgment</em>.”
    </p>

    <p>
        If these vulnerable and helpless individuals come to know God, they become
        our brothers and sisters in Christ. The time is fast approaching when our
        Lord will declare,
        <em>“Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these
            brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”</em>
        (Matthew 25:40, NLT). I pray that God will open our eyes to truly see and
        understand the profound message of Matthew 25:31-46. Amen.
    </p>

        me by phone or at the address given in the book.

            <b>A Hindu</b> is an adherent of Hinduism, one of the world's oldest religions,
            originating in the Indian subcontinent. Hindus follow diverse beliefs
            and practices, centred around principles like dharma (righteousness),
            karma (action and consequence), and moksha (liberation from the cycle of
            rebirth). They often worship multiple deities, including Vishnu, Shiva,
            and Lakshmi, though some focus on one supreme being. Sacred texts like
            the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita guide spiritual and ethical
            life. Hinduism emphasises rituals, festivals, yoga, and meditation.
            Hindus believe in reincarnation and strive for harmony between the self,
            nature, and the divine, promoting a spiritual way of life.<br /><br />
            Hindu society has traditionally been structured by the caste system, a
            rigid form of social stratification rooted in ancient texts like the
            Manusmriti. This system divides people into hierarchical groups based on
            birth: Brahmins (priests and scholars), Kshatriyas (warriors and
            rulers), Vaishyas (traders and farmers), and Shudras (labourers). Beyond
            these are Dalits (formerly "Untouchables"), historically relegated to
            degrading tasks and subjected to severe discrimination. The caste system
            has perpetuated inequality, limiting access to education, employment,
            and social mobility for lower-caste communities. Despite legal bans and
            reforms, caste-based discrimination persists, influencing politics,
            marriage, and daily life in many parts of India.

        <li id="fn001">
            <b>The Nairs</b>: The Nair (nāyəɾ) community is a well defined ‘caste’
            in Kerala, India. They follow the Hindu religion.<br /><br />

            In the Hindu hierarchical ‘caste’ system, Nairs belong to the lowest
            tier called The Shudras (šuḍrɑ). Still, they were within the caste
            system. Therefore, they were not regarded as outcastes or untouchables.
            However, when Hindu social rules were in force, a Nair had to stay
            thirty-two feet away from Brahmins, the priestly caste!<br /><br />

            The Nair Service Society works to strengthen and unite the Nair
            community. They are a powerful vote bank and a political pressure group,
            exercising their influence on successive governments.<br /><br />

            Before India’s independence in 1947, the Nairs served in royal armies
            and had their own militias. Therefore, they remained close to political
            classes and rulers.<br /><br />

            The Nair community is one of the few Matriarchial communities in the
            world. Until a century ago, Nairs never had a well defined nuclear
            family. The daughters lived with their mother even after their wedding.
            The official husband of a woman pays her regular visits. However, any
            man could spend the night with her. The glory and status of a household
            was often determined by the number of noctural visitors.<br /><br />

            Cousin marriage was once a common practice among Nairs. According to
            this practice, a maternal uncle’s daughter (cousin) is designated as her
            cousin’s future bride.

        <li id="fn009">
            The Hindus have several religious texts but they do not have a unified theology or system of belief. Here is
            a list of significant Hindu religious texts, along with brief descriptions. These were written in a language
            called Sanskrit.
            <ol style="list-style-type:none">
                <li><b>1. The Vedas</b> (Scriptures): The Vedas are the oldest and most revered scriptures in Hinduism,
                    consisting of four collections: Rigveda (hymns), Samaveda (melodies), Yajurveda (ritual
                    instructions), and Atharvaveda (incantations and spells). They outline religious rituals,
                    philosophies, and hymns dedicated to various deities. <br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: Only Brahmins (the priestly class) were traditionally allowed to study or
                    chant the Vedas. This exclusivity was enforced to maintain their control over religious rituals and
                    societal hierarchy.
                </li>

                <li><b>2. The Upanishads</b> (Philosophical Texts): The Upanishads are philosophical treatises that
                    explore the nature of reality, the self (Atman), and the ultimate truth (Brahman). They form the
                    basis of Hindu spiritual thought and focus on meditation and knowledge.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: Restricted to the upper castes, as they were considered esoteric and
                    meant for those trained in Vedic rituals, often excluding lower castes and women.
                </li>

                <li><b>3. The Bhagavad Gita</b> (The Song of God): A 700-verse scripture that is part of the Mahabharata
                    epic. It is a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Krishna, who advises him on duty (dharma), ethics,
                    and devotion amidst a moral crisis.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: While not as restricted as the Vedas, the Gita was traditionally
                    interpreted and taught by Brahmins, limiting its reach to educated classes.
                </li>

                <li><b>4. The Ramayana</b> (The Story of Rama): An epic narrative about Prince Rama, his exile, the
                    abduction of his wife Sita by the demon king Ravana, and his ultimate victory. It illustrates ideals
                    of duty, loyalty, and justice.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: While widely accessible as a story, its deeper spiritual teachings were
                    traditionally explained by Brahmins.
                </li>

                <li><b>5. The Mahabharata</b> (The Great Epic of Bharata): The longest epic poem in the world, detailing
                    the Kurukshetra war between two royal families, the Pandavas and the Kauravas. It addresses
                    morality, politics, and spirituality.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: Like the Ramayana, its storytelling was widespread, but its complex
                    philosophical discussions were often confined to the upper castes.
                </li>

                <li><b>6. The Manusmriti</b> (The Laws of Manu): An ancient legal text prescribing societal laws,
                    duties, and caste-based regulations. It enforces the caste system, defining roles and privileges
                    based on birth.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: Exclusively interpreted and enforced by Brahmins to legitimise their

                <li><b>7. The Puranas</b> (Mythological Histories): A collection of stories about gods, goddesses,
                    creation, and the universe. Popular examples include the Vishnu Purana and Shiva Purana. They are
                    more accessible and devotional in nature.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: Less restricted than other texts, but formal teaching often remained in
                    the hands of Brahmins.
                </li>

                <li><b>8. The Aranyakas</b> (Forest Treatises): Supplementary texts to the Vedas, detailing rituals and
                    symbolic interpretations, intended for hermits and ascetics living in forests.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: Reserved for Brahmins and upper-caste ascetics due to their esoteric
                    content.
                </li>

                <li><b>9. The Brahmanas</b> (Ritual Texts): Prose texts that explain the rituals and ceremonies
                    described in the Vedas. They provide instructions for priests conducting rituals.<br />
                    <b>Access Restriction</b>: Exclusively for Brahmins, as they were the custodians of ritual
                    knowledge.

            Only a minority of Indian population –the Brahmins and other fair-skinned "upper castes" – was allowed to
            learn Sanskrti or even listen to the reading of these religious texts, much less read it on their own. The
            punishment for violating this rule: Molten lead was to be poured into the ears of any downtrodden
            "untouchable" who happens to hear the reading of these texts!
            <br /><br />
            The monopoly of the Brahmins over sacred texts was rooted in their position at the top of the caste
            hierarchy. Restricting access reinforced their authority in religious, social, and political matters,
            ensuring that lower castes and women remained dependent on them for spiritual guidance and rituals. These
            restrictions created a knowledge gap that maintained societal inequalities for centuries.

            <b>Hindu ‘gods’</b>: Hinduism has two main streams: <br /><br />
            (i) a <b>philosophical Hinduism</b> that is essentially atheistic
            Pantheism. Those who follow this school seek enlightenment through yoga
            and transcendental meditation. Enlightenment is nothing but the
            realisation that man himself is divine, just as every thing else in the
            universe constitute the divine essence; <br /><br />
            (ii) <b>popular Hinduism</b> in which the devotee is distinct from the
            deities. According to certain ancient Hindu texts, there are 330 million
            gods and goddesses. According to the Vedas (scriptures), there are 33
            supreme deities. In any case, a Hindu is free to choose any god as his
            or her personal deity.

            <b>Puja or pooja</b>: A <i>puja</i> (pʊjə) is a Hindu ritual that
            involves worshiping a deity, spirit, or other aspect of the divine
            through prayer, invocations, songs, and rituals. Most Hindus perform a
            <i>puja</i>
            twice a day, and on special occasions and holidays. <br /><br />A symbol
            or image of the deity is used as a focal point for honoring and
            communicating with the god. This icon is believed to be filled with the
            deity’s “cosmic energy” or spirit.<br /><br />Offerings of flowers,
            food, incense, and light are made to the deity.<br /><br />The
            <i>puja</i> is usually concluded with an aarti, which is a ritual where
            light from wicks soaked in ghee (clarified butter) or camphor is offered
            to the deity.<br /><br />The word <i>puja</i> comes from Sanskrit and
            roughly translates to “reverence, honor, homage, adoration, or worship.”

            Ayyappan became a popular Hindu deity worshipped mostly by Hindus of
            southern India. Barefoot devotees make an annual trek in December to
            Sabarimala Hills to visit his temple. As preparation for the pilgrimage,
            they observe weeks of strict religious discipline. They don’t shave or
            trim their hair or nails during this period. Besides, they abstain from
            meat, alcohol, etc., during this time. Over 3 million pilgrims visited
            Sabarimala in 2024.
